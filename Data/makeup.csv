1712793712.0,How are you supposed to apply sunscreen under your face makeup?,"I usually just wear sunscreen on it's own or my Ilia face tint (which is SPF 40) when I need coverage.  However, I recently purchased the Fenti skin tint and I LOVE IT.  The only issue is that there is no SPF in it...

I use the cerave facial moisturizer with SPF 30 sunscreen in it but I don't think that it would be good under makeup.  It always leaves me a slight white cast too.  So I am now in the market for a good sunscreen, higher then SPF 30 that can go under your facial makeup.  Give me your best recommendations please!!



Oh yeah, and I also don't know how to wear sunscreen under makeup in general (bc I'm used to just wearing a skin-tint with SPF already in it).  

Am I able to wear primer on top of my sunscreen or will that break it down?  I'm going on vacation to Europe this summer so am looking for something that is long-lasting (hence why I was wondering about the primer situation) and good quality.  TIA!!",MakeupAddiction

1712788480.0,How do you guys feel about the new NARS blush?,"Do you like the new formula vs the old?

Overall I would say that it definitely seems to glide on smoother and seems more pigmented. I definitely appreciate the no talc too.

I wore the shades Orgasm and Orgasm X in the old formula, that I still have.

I’m not sure if the new shades are an EXACT match to the old. At first glance, they seem slightly peachier, but I think they change color depending on how the light catches, so it might just be my imagination. Overall, this isn’t a deal breaker, because it’s pretty hard to tell. 

Sorry if these pics aren’t great. I tried to take the best swatches in natural light I could (and please ignore my terrible dry hands lol)

The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pic is Orgasm X in the new formula on top and the old formula on the bottom. 4th and 5th pics are also Orgasm X (new on the left, old on the right) in different lighting. It seems that even though the new one looks peachier, when the light changes, it looks pinker. 

The 6th and 7th pics are Orgasm in the new formula on top and the old formula on the bottom. As you can see, the new one looks pinker in one light and peachier in the other, and vise versa.

I hope this was helpful.

Overall, I think I do like the new formula more, just because it seems like a smoother application and no talc. I’ll also do a hand wash test when I get home, and see which one stays on better - new or old formula, and update the post.

So do you guys like the new formula and which one do you prefer?",MakeupAddiction

Hello! I am here mostly to ask anybody who’s used hairspray as a setting spray if it’s worked out for you and how bad is it really for your skin? Also if there’s any gentler hairsprays that would work or if there’s a makeup setting spray you’ve tried that actually works. I have combination skin I have oily skin with dry patches around my mouth nose and eyes but a very oily t zone and cheek. I don’t like powders as they just cling to the texture of my skin and I’ve never enjoyed how they wear either but I’d be open to suggestions if anybody had a recommendation. I work in a deli bakery and I am frequently sweating from cleaning fryers and washing ovens and baking stuff. I work 8hours and I love wearing makeup but my foundation and concealer and blush wear really bad no matter what i seem to do. Below I will include products i’ve tried and the makeup I wear daily.

Daily Base: 
- Elf camo concealer all over or nyx can’t stop won’t stop concealer
-Nyx bare with me priming spray
-elf putty blush and I set it with a milani blush
that’s all, i don’t use any other base products 

Sprays I’ve tried: 
- UD all nighter
-Milani make it last
-Nyx matte setting spray
-Nyx Bare with me setting spray (it’s what I use to prime now)
-Elf setting spray (black one)
-Hard candy setting spray (the pink and green one)
-One size setting spray
-Morphe Setting Mist
-Revolution Setting spray (it’s the sport one)
-Ben Nyx Final seal (this was years ago but i may try again) 
-Dollar store setting spray
-Pixi setting spray

Powders I’ve used:
-Maybelline fit me the loose and pressed
-Airspun loose
-Etude house zero sebum
-Innisfree no sebum
-The Saem Perfect Pore pink
-cornstarch
-elf hd powder
-wet n wild (the clear one it’s like 3$)
-l’oréal powder foundation
-Laura Mercier loose powder 
-dollar store powder (it’s the clear bpure)

Hi 👋 
I usually wear the shades Stromboli in the NARS radiant long wear foundation and shade 290 in Fenty but recently I have got Malasma due to me being pregnant with my son and my skin tone has become slightly darker.
So much so that these shades are now too light for my skin tone.

This is me with no make up on in natural lighting by my window.
The last two photos are swatches in the shade Stromboli and then 290 in the Fenty foundation.

https://imgur.com/a/RNQeRi7

I do colour correct but then this usually changes the colour of the foundation slightly.
I don’t know if I should buy a darker foundation or if there’s anything I can do to make these foundations work.

Does anyone else suffer with Malasma or hyperpigmentation?
If so what do you do to make your foundation shades work?

This was me wearing both foundation shades before I got Malasma.
The first photo I’m wearing the shade Stromboli and the second I’m wearing the shade 290 in the Fenty foundation.

1712756299.0,Charlotte Tilbury Setting Srpay vs. Maybelline Setting Spray,"Hey! I know this may sound super strange to some of you, but yeah, basically what the title says

I purchased the classic Maybelline Lasting Fix about 10 months ago and it worked pretty well for my skin. I applied it between layers of foundation and bronzer/blush for nights out and it served its purpose.

Now, after a while I got really into make up and decided to invest in the CT Setting Spray for a more luxurious experience, assuming it would last even longer and work better. Turns out it didn't. My make up doesn't last as long at all.

I've tried applying it in different ways: Before primer and foundation, after layers and for the final touch. Or Just at the end. Or just at the beginning. Or in between steps. It doesn't matter, my make up just fades away. Since it was pretty expensive and the reviews are great, I was wondering if maybe I'm doing something wrong. Should I try something different? I have combination skin with an oily T zone but it's pretty manageable. For skin care prep, I wash my face wirth a salicilic acid cleanser, and always apply a niacinamide and a hyaluronic acid serum and finish with the Neutrogena watergel hydrating cream.

My make up routine for going out (complexion wise) usually consists of the L'Or primer by Guerlain, the Les Beiges Chanel Foundation, the make up by mario contour stick, the rare beauty blush and some huda beauty cherry blossom loose powder

1712753740.0,What's the best foundation without sunflower products in the ingredients?,"Hi there! I have super sensitive, combination, acne prone skin (my skin was relatively clear but still sensitive, combination pre IUD placement, if that matters). I'm allergic to sunflower, and pretty much everything with sunflower listed in the ingredients makes me super itchy. For this reason, I tend to avoid foundation altogether. Rifling through ingredients lists is already tedious for lotions, shampoos, conditioners, body washes , etc., especially since sunflower is a very common cosmetics ingredient.

The only reason I want foundation currently is because I have an event coming up that will have a ton of photos. Because my IUD has trashed my skin, I'd really like to not feel that way when the camera comes out.

Does anyone have any suggestions on sunflower-free foundations? I really don't care about cost/budget/brand. I'm also willing to buy two shades and mix to get the right match, if necessary, but a wide range of shades is a plus.",MakeupAddiction

1712722679.0,13 year old makeup. Safe to wear? ,"Okay so I have a BECCA highlighter & a Too Faced blush.

When I was around 14, I got really bad acne. I was miserable. I begged my mom for makeup to cover them. At first she didn’t allow it but then she gave in. For my 14th birthday, her and I went to Sephora and she bought me $300 worth of makeup. Those two things happen to be in the makeup stash she bought me. 

I am way older now. 

The BECCA highlighter and the too faced blush both are cracked into pieces. I plan to use some alcohol and fix it but my thing is.. is it safe to wear? 

I have not worn them in a long time. Just kept them with me for sentimental value because they were happen to be couple of my first makeup items gifted by my mom. I adore them.

1712714233.0,Foundation lifting when i apply cream contour. ,"So I feel like I have tried absolutely everything! And when I apply my contour it lifts exactly where I’m trying to tap it on. I’ll explain my routine in steps along with the application method. I have combination skin that leans more on the dry side
Skin prep: toner(cereve hydrating toner), essence( cos rx peptide), serum (ordinary niacinimide sp?), sunscreen (elf mineral spf), and moisturizer. I let each layer mostly dry with a fan before the next layer.

Primer: I’ve tried with out primer, with a griping primer, elf putty primer and hourglass veil primer. I’ve tried just the gripping primer, just the putty primer, just the veil primer alone. I’ve tried using the pore filling primer on my t zone and the gripping primer around the face. Sometimes I’ll spritz on a setting mist over the primer or just using a spray as the primer. I’ve tried hydro grip primer and urban decay all nighter. 

Foundation: now I know the two foundations I use have different bases but I’ve also tried them on their own and with the associated primer match. I sometimes use the lancôme teint idole ultra wear care & glow foundation or the elf glow cc cream (med/full coverage) and the fenty tinted moisturizer or the elf halo glow “foundation” sheer to light coverage. I use either a foundation brush in a buff/pat application or a damp beauty blender. Sometimes I will spray a setting spray over like milk hydro grip or peach and lily glass veil mist and I also tried a fixing spray like urban decay all nighter (this method helps the most). I’ve also not sprayed anything. I always let it dry a few min before the next application which is where it gets dicey. 😩

Cream contour or bronzer step
Ok so here is where I find out if I’m gonna have a bad or amazing make up day. 
Sometimes I just use bronzer on the high points for a little glow and sometimes I use contour, sometimes I do both. But most of the time it lifts in the shape of my brush or beauty blender or won’t blend out seamlessly and looks patchy. 
I’ve used  kilo Milano stick contour, abh contour stick and elf halo glow bronzer contour in a cool tone. I’ve applied directly to the skin and then try to blend out, I’ve applied directly to my brush then my face, I’ve applied to my brush the blended it out on the back of my hand, I’ve also applied to the back of my hand and then blend out before using tapping motions onto my cheek bones just slightly about the shadows of my face. 

I feel like I have tried everything but this new “hack” which has you applying moisturizer to the face, a thin layer of translucent powder, a setting spray (let that dry) and then a primer before foundation but that just seems crazy especially since I have dry to combo skin. 

*I’ve also tried under painting 

I was going to attach a picture showing where the make up is completely lifted, and one spot, but the rest of the face is flawless, but it won’t let me . I’m allowed to send it to anyone individually. I’m more than willing to do so because any help would be greatly appreciated.",MakeupAddiction

What's the point of bronzing drops?

I kind of get the idea of bronzer...? It adds some color and some depth and makes you look darker (the appeal of bronzer has always been a mystery to me, tbh, which is probably why I can't figure out the point of bronzer drops)? 

But I just saw an ad for a new bronzer drop product and they literally just mixed some of the drops with moisturizer and put it on. And in the end she just looked slightly darker. So why not just mix a few drops of darker foundation with moisturizer instead of getting bronzer drops? Or use self tanner?

1712689252.0,Is dewy foundation a solution for dryness?,"Hi all!

I've dug through this sub in search of some help and while it has been a great help pointing me in the right direction I haven't found an answer for my particular case.

For reference I'm a trans woman with dark facial hair, my routine as it is now is: elf orange colour corrector and L'Oreal Infallible full coverage concealer to cover up the hair shadow, set with elf halo glow setting powder, then Maybelline Fit Me matte foundation. I also use moisturizer, sunscreen, and primer to start. 

I have combo oily/dry skin, after a few hours of wear my lower face gets pretty cracked and creased. From what I've figured out this is probably because of a moisture issue. I think using setting powder worsens it. 

I'm curious if a dewy foundation could work with color corrector underneath. I know some foundations don't have enough coverage and the color of the corrector can bleed through the finished look. Could this help my dryness issue? Any alternatives around setting powder to prevent transfer of color corrector to the foundation or avoid excessive dryness? 

Any help is appreciated!

1712660950.0,Lipstick recommendations for lips with scars?,"Hi! I have a small scar in the corner on my lip where some normal skin tissue is mixing with the lip tissue, making it appear whiter and having a different texture.  (Here is a pic https://ibb.co/RyMJJXL )

I loved wearing lipsticks but since getting the scar many of them are just disappearing very fast from that area and then i end up looking uneven with that white shade showing up.

So far I had a decent experience with Nyx soft matte ones, but I wish I could find something that is really good at covering and staying that way 

Any suggestions? TYSM! 💖",MakeupAddiction
1712660641.0,Make up price increases - are products still worth it?,"Let me preface this rant-ish post by saying I understand that price increases are happening all across the board, I know luxury makeup has never been a necessity, and that you rightfully pay for quality, but...

I just can't with makeup prices anymore. I don't have a crazy collection (save for the lip department, lol) and can comfortably afford make up items. Yesterday I saw a Clinique launch I immediately liked - the new duo shadow sticks - and headed over to Sephora to see the prices, fully intending to buy one. They retailed between 33 and 38 euros! 

I would have happily forked over anything around 25 Euros, but 38 seems wildly unnecessary. I have not bought much makeup in the last year, and this has led me to reflect on why - there is very little I can justify those prices for. Even my Gucci baume, the only nude lipstick I ever loved, retails around 40 Euros... and even if I really like it, I can't justify spending that kind of money on a single item. It's not even about being sad because I can't afford it - it's because I can clearly see that even if I went to the store and purchased it, I would leave feeling disapppointed. Same with my Hourglass lip slips - gorgeous color and payoff. Is it worth 40 euros? I just don't feel it is.

I was wondering if anyone was experiencing any similar feelings of falling out of love with makeup because of the insane price hikes - I always loved it, but I am now at a point where I really don't enjoy shopping anymore.",MakeupAddiction

Currently using Laura Mercier setting powder and Lancôme primer & Lancôme concealer but happy to re look at these too. The concealer doesn’t seem to cover my eye bags much tbh.

1712629779.0,Favorite makeup techniques? (not products but application methods etc.),"What are your favorite makeup techniques/tips (i am basically talking everything but products). 


My tips: 

As an example i apply mascara using disposable wands to get very natural fluttery looking lashes (you use less products beacause you juuust cover each lash which is why it looks so natural and this way only product formula matters not the applicator type. Also it takes much longer for mascaras to dry out). 

For higher coverage i let products sit on the skin for a while and blend out with a brush (dense brushes are 100% the way to go for highest coverage). 

If you need to adjust the colour of foundation or anything like that you can just use eyeshadow. (making a foundation/concealer/bb/whatever less orange by adding blue, make a foundation less pink by adding green, making it less yellow by adding purple etc). Beware eyeshadow adds coverage to your cc cream, foundation, concealer. Also you can use eyeshadow as a blush, bronzer or setting powder in a pinch (obviously pick the appropriate shade).",MakeupAddiction

here’s my routine!
1) moisturise with zerobase pump action cream
2) use dr jart to cover red rosacea patches (only just above jawline, i don’t usually do anywhere else)
3) apply foundation, i use l’oréal true match foundation i try not to blend around my top lip or chin
4) conceal with the l’oréal perfect match concealer. i conceal my spot scars on my chin, spot scars on my top lip, lightly under my eyes and in between my brows
5) blush and highlight, i use elf halo glow wands
6) i pat out my creases then set with the collection powder from boots under my eyes and around my nose and sometimes around my lips
7) i do my brows with the soap and glory archery pencil and also use my brown pencil as eyeliner (am yet to buy an actual brown liner)
8) set with the elf dewy coconut setting spray

1712598606.0,Benetint but darker?,"I love Benefit's original(?) Rose shade lip tint. I'm not sure if it's just me but it seems like it has this really sheer watery formula that I love, but the other colors of Benefit Lip Tint are creamy/more opaque. I'm wondering if another brand makes a darker lip tint in an almost purple/burgundy shade.

I feel like my natural upper lip line has seriously softened/blurred from post-waxing inflammation. I have dark skin and dark purpley-brown lips, and I think a stain like that could help me make that line more crisp.

Things I love about [Benetint](https://www.benefitcosmetics.com/en-us/product/benetint-cheek-lip-stain-FM173.html):

\- very watery and sheer but buildable. I can make it sooo subtle which is nice because I don't really know how to do a full face of makeup. Without that, any one feature standing out too much looks funny to me (on my own face in the mirror, not when I'm looking at someone else who has done this!)

\- truly stains and doesn't really rub off on anything. This is great for me because I'm not used to remembering it's there and being careful with it.

1712597169.0,Dupe/replacement for L'Oréal infallible matte foundation??,"Hi everyone! Please help a girl out! So I used to wear the L'Oréal infallible matte wear foundation for years and it was perfect:

- Dried matte and I never needed powder lol
- Stayed on during my 12 hour shifts and more
- NO creases or lines
- Really good full coverage

BUT they've changed the shade and formula completely so I can no longer wear it and I'm desperately trying to find a new daily foundation for work. Or just any foundation that fits my needs.

I tried Huda Beauty's faux filter and as much as I wanted to love it, it looks so oily on me unless I powder a lot on top which I hate the feeling of and it feels a bit sticky on my face. Am I doing something wrong with this?

Does anyone know another brand/foundation that I can try instead?

I used to wear *230 honey* for the L'Oréal foundation and I was matched with the shade *Latte* for the Huda Beauty foundation if that helps.

Thank you <3",MakeupAddiction

I use moisturizer before going to bed and a little before applying makeup along with the elf power grip primer. Both my foundation (Catrice liquid coverage) and concealer (Elf Camo concealer) are water-based and I use a bit of setting powder under my eyes + setting spray

At first I thought that it may be because of dry skin but I‘ve been moisturising well and my skin doesn’t feel dry at all.

It lists the places you can use it on the front, Sephora included. It was only $50 so I got a few small things. I used to shop there on a semi regular basis but lately I haven’t.  

When I got up to the register I gave the woman my gift card. She tried swiping it on a handheld scanner and the on the register. It kept saying there was an error. My card wasn’t worn or scratched (it was brand new) but it wouldn’t go through. She told me there wasn’t anything she could do, like type it in, since it wasn’t a Sephora gift card. Annoying but okay, I go online to buy the things I want. 

I go through the app and realize it won’t let me put my gift card in as a gift card. I have to run it as a credit card. Fine, I put it in and go to check out. My total is over $50 so I try putting my credit card in to pay the balance. Nope. You can’t split payments between credit cards. 

I email customer service hoping to get it resolved. Their response was since it’s a third party gift card it has to be run as a credit card and there is no way to split payments between credit cards. They then suggested I buy a Sephora gift card with the happy card. 

I did the same thing on the Ulta app and magically they allow you to use third party gift cards as gift cards. Maybe I’m over reacting but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.  So now I have $6 on a gift card. I’ll just go to one of the other places on there to use it but I’m just annoyed. ",MakeupAddiction

Just turned 35 and I feel like what I used to think looks good on me just doesn’t land anymore. I used to feel like I could wear a winged liner or winged out eyeshadow shape all the time and now I can’t figure it out. I’ve tried big, small, thick, thin liner and they all just look weird to me. Anytime I do a winged shadow shape it looks weirdly like a comma on my eyes instead of a straight line (does that make sense). Took some photos of some makeup I thought looked good (photo 1 and 2) when I was doing it but then something feels off (mostly liner), so the third and fourth photos are after I wiped off most of the liner.

I like to wear both “natural” and “glam” makeup, but am I destined to just stay in a more natural space?

1712507706.0,Brown Adjacent Nude Blushes???,"So to me a ""nude blush"" is almost like the blush equivalent of a nude lip, something that is the same vibe as your natural skin tone/colour, with a *slight* bit of ""unnatural"" colour (red, pink, orange, purple etc) added. 

However, every blush described as a ""nude blush"" is quite beige-adjacent. It used to be like that for ""nude"" lip products before but the offerings for deep skin are so much better now.

1712505758.0,Sheer-Light Coverage just won’t work on me!!,"Good morning, beautiful and knowledgeable beauty community!! 

I am having an issue with several lighter coverage complexion products I’ve tried.  Although I do have a dry skin type, and texture, the issue I am having is that the complexion products I’ve been trying are accentuating texture/wrinkles and maybe dry patches, I didn’t even know I had. Lol I say “maybe dry patches” because I genuinely don’t know what it is! I exfoliate fairly regularly, prep my skin very well before application, but it never fails, the thinner skin tints, tinted moisturizers, or lower coverage foundations that I WANT to work for me, end up making my skin look much, much worse than it is naturally! 

I’ve gotten to the point (age) that I am going for a lower coverage, more natural look than I used to.  So, I have been trying more lower coverage products. This morning I tried the Rare Beauty Positive Light Tinted Moisturizer and it immediately started “grabbing” and showing texture that you can’t see OR feel on my bare face! I do have maturing skin, so I have pores, wrinkles, fine lines. But I truly don’t have a huge issue with those showing. My main goal in wearing a base/complexion product is to minimize the redness in my skin. My plan this morning was to wear the tinted moisturizer all over and add extra coverage with my Tower 28 Serum Concealer. But after taking pictures in desperation to bring to you talented individuals, I had to immediately wash it all off! 

The Rare Beauty tinted moisturizer isn’t the only complexion product that does this on me either. Some others are: Iconic London Super Smoother Blurring Skin Tint, Tower 28 Sunny Days Tinted Sunscreen, Saie Slip Tint Tinted Moisturizer, & Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow.

These products look so beautiful on so many different skin types, including those much more mature than mine. People are constantly raving about all of them and their reviews are endless. I just can’t figure out why they won’t work for me, despite trying several different primers and on bare (well moisturized) skin.

The only products I have found SOME success with are Clinique Even Better Makeup & Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can get these to work on my skin? Or should I just give up and come to terms with being stuck wearing medium-full coverage products forever?!

NOTE: I have photos but it says I’m not allowed to attach them. 😕

1712497369.0,"Need help! Need recommendations SPF, primer, and foundation for dry/combination skin ","Long story short I lost my old foundation, facial sunscreen, and primer. I’ve been looking to get new products anyway because my skin has changed over the last few years. 

My skin has become dryer with age and new medication. 

I was previously using:

1. Nars sheer glow foundation in Siberia

2. Unseen sunscreen prior to having dry skin, but it wasn’t moisturizing enough after. I’ve started using EltaMD but it pills with my foundation.  

3. Need a primer recommendation— the unseen screen was doing double duty. 

Product needs:

1. Wide range of shades. I’m VERY pale. For reference, the lightest shade of Nars Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer is too dark and leaves a noticeable orange cast/difference in shade from my neck/chest. I have this problem often when trying to find a shade match. Let me know if I should add a photo. 

2. Products don’t pill when layered. I find this is the hardest and is why I came to you beautiful gurus. 

3. Price point: For items that I KEEP, I’m not super concerned with price. Meaning that the item needs to come in a sample size that I can try or be return/exchangeable.

1. My skin isn't really nice. Sebaceous filaments all over and it's most visible in my U Zone and around and on the nose. Some places have acne and its combo skin.

2. I'm asian. Not the biggest eyes with epicanthic folds, literally yellowish-pale skin. downturned and fuller lower lips, but not the biggest either. my nose is just a straight nose? kinda snub maybe.

3. more details in my eyes (since i want to do some eye makeup), its not the typical asian eye? no it doesn't have double eyelids instead it has epicanthic folds. but the bottom of my eye has this weird space? below them. it's not eyebags or anything, its literally this space under my eyes and my lower lashes just sit on top of them. it connects my epicanthic folds and it creates this huge natural eyeliner i guess. i've had them since i was born, theyre like part of my eye. that included is my eye shape. ive been searching so long but i cant find the name.

4. i dont know how to do skincare under 
makeup. makeup itself feels really sticky and annoying to me and skincare makes it even stickier so idk what to do. every time i put on makeup, i use the elf poreless putty primer. doesnt really help and it makes it oily. then i put on kosa bb cream and its honestly so patchy. i use wet n wild photofocus setting spray. i use the rare beauty highlighter and put on cream blush. i use a makeup puff to blend everything out by the way. i put on more setting spray and thats it. i gave up on mascara since my lashes are short anyway. is it wrong? i need tips and new makeup stuff to buy so i can perfect it.

1712454024.0,Has anyone tried the Karla Cosmetics Fix Potion?,"I’m willing to accept the cause of my issues could be operator error here, but I’m genuinely running out of ideas.

I love multichrome/color shift glitter eyeshadows, so as you’d expect Karla Cosmetics kept coming across my social media feeds. I decided to try just a couple of products out: a duo chrome loose eyeshadow, and their Fix Potion Glitter Eye Primer. I’ve been previously using the NYX glitter primer which works great, but every time I purchase it the packaging splits before I’m even halfway through it so I’m throwing out an almost full tube because the product is drying out. I’ve been looking out for something to replace it and was hoping this was it.

I have tried every way I can think of to use this primer, and it honestly seems like it does absolutely nothing. When applying it on top of eyeshadow to add the glitter, it takes all my eyeshadow right off. I’ve tried applying the loose eyeshadow to it when it’s still wet, let it dry a little so it just felt tacky, and even mixing it with the powder. It just looks like sheer blue glitter, barely visible, no shift, and it ends up all over my glasses and my face within an hour. I tried these methods with some of my pressed Terra Moons eyeshadows just as sort of an experiment, and even those end up all over the place with this primer. This never happened with the NYX.

It seems like everyone in all the reviews absolutely loves this stuff, which is making me suspect maybe I’m doing something wrong. Has anyone had better luck with this product? If you have any suggestions for anything better, I’m open to that as well. Thanks!",MakeupAddiction

What is the lippie everyone is splurging for during the ulta beauty sale vs sephora?

I'm debating between clarins lip oil ( not sire which one apricot or yes honey)  vs the ole henreikhsen one ( strawberry ? ) 

. Something i can wear overnight would be ideal. Or should i go for the summer fridays  one ? The mint one is cute 

But the hourglass phantom sticks look really pretty too. I'm confused I like the mint/menthol feeling I get from the elf lips oils 

I'm a insider at sephora so I want to take advantage of the ulta prestige brands 20 percent off. 

For other non lippies . Searching for a undereye setting powder.

I’m very fair and i also love the outdoors, so unsurprisingly my dermatologist said my face, chest, and arms are very sun damaged and i need to start wearing sunscreen daily. 

All of the sunscreens I’ve seen require reapplication every 2 hours or less. About 50% of the time i put sunscreen on before makeup, but i have to start reapplying especially on days when im outside (which is every day unless it’s raining).

How do y’all reapply sunscreen over your makeup? Do you just get a spray sunscreen? Or just rub it on and touch up your makeup? My makeup currently consists of concealer, blush, mascara, brow pencil, a lip product or two, and sometimes eyeshadow. So rubbing a sunscreen on there will make my blush and concealer slide off or look muddy and weird.

I'm almost out of my elf powder and I'm trying to figure out if I shpuld repurchase since I know I like it or try something new.

1712370604.0,Eyes hurting because of makeup?,"So recently my eyes have been feeling irritated and hurting whenever I put on makeup and kind of when I do my skincare and I don’t think it’s both or at least not causing it I don’t know because I’ve been using the same product brands and recently got new products so I don’t think it’s the ingredients or from being expired. And today I threw away my beauty blender and eyelash curler because those 2 things specifically I’ve been using it ever since I started using and getting into makeup but I threw it away. Also I usually get allergies around this time of year, so what could it be that is causing my eyes to be feeling like that?  Was it because of the beauty blender and eyelash curler? Allergies? Both?

*Side note:
• I don’t wear eyeshadow.
• I’ve been using less products more specifically concealer and try avoiding getting any makeup overall in my eyes.
• It’s mostly my right eye and has been extremely watery. 
• From where I live, it has been recently windy.
• The products I use around my eyes is the fit me foundation, concealer, and press powder, and a waterproof mascara. Sometimes i put highlighter in the corners of my eyes but recently haven’t been putting some on.

1712334091.0,Products that surprised you?,"Which products have surprised you (good or bad)?

I'll start with some of my standouts.


Good surprises:

- Clinique's ""High Impact"" mascara

I was gifted some Clinique products (which I'm not a big fan of) and my usual mascara dried out so I used it out of desperation. It is the most natural looking mascara I have ever used. It doesn't look like I'm wearing mascara, it looks like I got my eyelashes tinted or am wearing super natural falsies. It is so effortless to apply and doesn't clump up AT ALL. It's such a good every day mascara if you're going for a no-makeup/minimal makeup look. I would have never tried this product if it hadn't been gifted to me but I'm going to purchase it now.

- Aquaphor as chapstick

I don't know why I didn't try this sooner. I've always struggled with chapped lips and have never found a chapstick that left my lips feeling truly moisturized. I finally googled ""what do dermatologists recommend for chapped lips"" and found Aquaphor as a suggestion and holy crap it's amazing. My lips look so much less wrinkly now because they're moisturized and protected for the first time in my life, lol. My fiance even commented on how nice my lips have looked lately.

- Wet n Wild Tinted Hydrator

Honestly I like this foundation more than nearly all other ones I've tried. It may not have the extreme lasting power of some other ones (it'll start to break down and settle in my problem areas by the end of the day), but it looks so pretty on the skin. I put this on and my fiance and future MIL both commented on how flawless my skin looked. She's a bit of a luxury brand makeup snob and she was demanding to know what foundation I was wearing because she said my skin looked like porcelain.



Bad surprises:

- IT Cosmetics CC cream

Ew. Thick, nasty, greasy. I'm so confused when I see people recommend it. Waste of money.

- IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereye corrector

Same thing! Thick, greasy formula that creased like crazy on me. It looked so heavy and unflattering. I did not understand the hype at all. Waste of money.

- Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara

It looked nice I guess, but it is literally the only mascara I have ever had issues with transfer and smudging. Did not repurchase. The Loreal Lash Paradise mascara is just as good, if not better, and doesn't smudge or flake on me like this did.

The only base/face makeup I do is concealer under my eyes and on my blemishes, and then blush. I used to do more makeup but now I prefer to keep it simple. however, I have an issue where my upper lip area always has at least a bit of redness and my normal concealer doesn't work for it. My upper lip area has a bit of a dryish/bumpy texture even when I use extra moisturizer on the area, so the concealer often doesn't blend well on top of it, and even when I still use it despite this it doesn't cover up the redness very well. I've tried looking for green color correctors but the vast majority of them seem to be intended to use under foundation/some kind of base and would look too green to use alone. I see Dr Jarts being talked about a lot, but I've read from a lot of reviews that it doesn't actually work well on dry skin so it doesn't seem like that would work for me. I'm considering the erborian cc red correct, but will I be able to just use it on my upper lip? Or will I have to use it all over my face to make it look even?

1712261148.0,L'oreal Lash Paradise causing rash/chemical burn?,"I have always used this mascara no issue. In December I started getting horrific rashes on both eye lids, and underneath my right eye every time I wear this mascara. I am wondering if anyone else has had this happen to them? Just so odd it's been out of the blue. Not sure if they changed formula or what? The burning, swelling red painful rash does NOT start up until I was it off. I know it's not makeup remover because I have it if I use soap and water, lotion and baby wipes, and micellar water. It takes like a week to go away. It turns into a dry scaly red patch once the intense burning and swelling subsides. ",MakeupAddiction
1712260159.0,Help me find the makeup brand I lost!,"Ok, so this is gonna be a long story. Back when I was an early teen, I borrowed my mom's makeup (nothing offensive, mostly Chapstick and shimmery eye shadow). One day we were at a museum, and I bent over a device you'd put a penny in for donations, and out of my purse fell a specific piece of makeup I had borrowed without asking permission. It was gone forever, and to this day I feel bad I lost it. I've always wanted to find it again and replace it, but we've come to the issue: I can't remember the brand! I'm hoping that by giving enough info, someone here might know what I'm talking about, so here we go!

* I'm almost certain it was a trio (but it could be a quad) of shimmery eyeshadow
* colors: white/champagne shade, a light brown and a dark brown
* the palette was small and rectangular, the pan was deep and the lid wasn't screwed in place, it could be removed completely. The material of the palette was clear plastic/acrylic and the colors within the palette touched, they were not devided.
* I vaguely remember it being an Elizabeth Arden brand, but when I search online I can't find anything resembling what I have in mind, so I'm guessing it's not that brand after all. I also looked into almay but didn't find what I was looking for either. As you might guess, my mom didn't shop in the high end makeup section, but you never know, she was reallyyyy upset when I lost this specific piece of makeup
* I'm 31 now and this happened when I was around 12? And since it belonged to my mother we can guess it was a pretty old piece of makeup, she wasn't one to buy such things frequently.

I think thats the max amount of info I can give in this post! My mom has M.S. now, so her memory can't recall such details, but I'm really hoping collectively we might find it!!! 🙏 Thanks in advance for any help!

Edit: I'm from Canada, Quebec, and I added a drawing of what I remember the packaging looked like!

1712259337.0,Milani Stay Put Infinite Liner works wayyy too well. ,"I bought Milani Stay Put Infinite Liner because reviews said that it's pretty indestructible. Even on Reddit it was pretty well received. The formula was changed, and then changed back (more or less, recent reviews were mostly cries of joy that it's back).

Well it works too well in the staying department IMO. Anything I used, I had to SCRUB to get it off. Micellar water, 3 different cleansing balms, make up remover, cleanser. All had great reception in removing make up. My other stuff came off flawlessly. Holding it for a minute didn't work. It's my first liquid liner, so I thought that was just how this type of formula worked. 

I then got another version of Milani's liquid liner. Off in 2 rubs with make up remover and it didn't budge beforehand so it's not like it has terrible staying power.

How do you Milani cultists get the Stay Put Infinite Liner off? ",MakeupAddiction

Generally I just want a very casual look that looks more natural without clumps. Like my natural eyelashes but just *slightly* more enhanced. As I do find that naked eye-lashes can look weird if I'm wearing a full face of make-up.

1712179810.0,Looking for colourful and/or shimmery eyeshadow reccs that are buildable and apply + last well without primer.,"Hey, so I'm more of a minimal products type of person, I don't use complexion products at all besides liquid blush or bronzer. And this is because I'm autistic and have a sensory sensitivity to having too much product on, especially if it feels thick or not skin breathable. 

That being said I'm very heavy on the eye makeup, and lean towards heavy eyeliner looks and smokey eyeshadows (blacks, cool browns). I trend towards more buildable and sheer formulas as I find high pigment to be very jarring when I don't use foundation. My holy grail eyeshadow for everyday makeup atm is Bobbi Brown Cream Eyeshadow Stick in Bark. I also use alot of Korean and Japanese eyeshadows because they are buildable and are generally made to be worn without primer. The problem is I'm sick of sticking to neutrals and nudes. 

However, I've always wanted to do more colorful, fairy-like eyeshadow looks, especially for spring summer. Colors like white shimmer, subtle iridescent shades, blues, greens, purples and turquoise. I've tried some Japanese and Korean brands for these colors but they really suck in staying power because I guess their formulas work best for nudes. 

Please give me reccomendations for brands, formulas to look out for or specific shades! My skin tone is medium olive (I'm East Asian but I like tanning). Also I prefer single shadows or quads over huge palettes because I'm trying to keep my collection small. I live between the UK and Japan so brands available in these places will be appreciated.

When I started my Fit Me shade search I did not have the NARS foundation yet and the only shade reference I had was the MAC NC20 shade. After trusting Findation and adding the MAC shade NC20 in its system I got the Fit Me shade 128 and I bought and tried it and it was obviously too dark and warm on me.
Then after getting matched with the NARS Gobi at Sephora and learning my undertone is neutral and leaning to yellow, I went and ordered the Fit Me shade 124 which is a little bit lighter than the 128 l had tried and in the neutral group of tones (more specifically in the neutral cools), once again it was too dark for me.
So which shade do you recommend I try now? The 120 shade is in the neutral cools as well but I don't know if it's still too dark. I don't feel like trying the shades that are lighter than the 120 because those shades are in either the warm or cool undertones (except for the 112 and 102 which I'm sure would be too pale for me).

My base looks decent and hydrated, I guess, when u apply all my cream products, but as soon as I put powder on via setting/baking... I look a mess. The makeup looks dull and like a completely different colour and so thick and ugly

Also, I'm not using pale powder. My powders are dark brown, and I have a lighter one, too, with a more yellowish tone for brightness. I use the last two shades of the sleek setting powder for reference. 

I've tried sort of moistening it up with setting spray after, but it just leaves a sheen that doesn't do the job. My main problem is whenever I try to dust the setting powder off...it dosen't come off...so imagine you bake and the powder just stays there and in that exact shape too....Awful.

1712140432.0,Oily skin foundation,"Hello! I have oily skin, so all of the foundations I own are very matte, but are some days when I want a more natural look, plus heavy matte foundation everyday is not a very good option for my acne prone skin.
 Do you have any recommendations regarding foundations that are able to keep oil away-it’s ok if they become more luminous throughout the day, but i don’t want them separating- but are not very matte? Also, i would prefer non-comedogenic ones, and if you could also tell me what primer you pair them with and if they’re water or silicone based. 

I was thinking about getting one of the Nars ones because I know my shade, but any recommendations are aprecciated.

1712134183.0,Pressed face powder recommendations,"Hi all. I'm looking for a new pressed powder to wear daily. I do not want a full coverage powder foundation or a setting powder... I prefer a more light up to medium coverage powder and I like having it in compact form so I can keep it in my bag. I've tried many drugstore and prestige powders but as of the past few years I feel like everything is either just a very light setting powder or a super full coverage foundation. I do not wear foundation daily, just some concealer for my dark circles and I set that with a Laura Mercier loose eye powder. I'd prefer something I could buy at Ulta, Macy's, or a drugstore as those stores are closest to me. I already have loose setting powders for whenever I do a glam look for occasions.


It's been over ten years now maybe but back in my early twenties Revlon used to sell the Nearly Naked powder and that was my absolute favorite. It had such a soft silky texture and made my face look airbrushed without needing any other products layered under it. It didn't last all day in oily parts of my face but I don't care about needing to touch up every so often. I've never found anything like that powder again. I still have an okay powder from besame that I use currently but that was also discontinued. Right now I'm using the Maybelline fitme or Revlon photo ready but neither are as good as that old Revlon one. I can't remember the last time I ordered a prestige brand as I feel like none of them offer a regular pressed powder anymore, it's all powder foundation or translucent setting powders.",MakeupAddiction

for reference, right now im using the rare beauty pore diffusing primer, and while i love the way it makes my skin feel very smooth and ""primed"", it just takes all the glow away and i feel like my skin dries out so much faster. any help?? :,)

1712099494.0,I had to throw everything out. Now seeking new holy grails!,"Hi there friends

**TLDR — I had pink eye I need all new makeup and need help.**

About 1.5 months ago I got really sick. One of my worst symptoms from this virus was pink eye. First time in my life that has ever happened to me and it was pretty severe. It hurt SO MUCH from the swelling. I looked like I’d been beaten, it was AWFUL!! From what I heard it usually clears up on its own (when it’s due to a virus not from poo-poo in your eyeballs) but for me that was not the case and I eventually had to go to the doctor to get it figured out. Blah blah blah, I’m fine it cleared up

Doctor told me to throw away all of my makeup, and I was a little bit hesitant to do that because I really don’t wear makeup a lot. I never wore any when I was sick with those symptoms. I stupidly was like “meh, I’ll give it a while and just sanitize my stuff and I’ll be OK.” — Went to a party and put on a SMALL amount of mascara (that’s all!) — bloop bloop, here’s the goop again. Not severe but enough to make me realize I really do need to dump all my products.

Which leads me to you wonderful gurus!! I see this as an opportunity to reset my life and buy products that are actually GOOD and not just random things that I’ve acquired over the years. I had some OLD SHIT… I’m 34 and I have a good job these days so I’m OK with making a decent investment in my looks.

Also, I’m pretty sure I should dump ALL of my makeup not just the things that are just for the eyes. Like they all were mixed up in my bag so I just feel like it’s better to fully reset everything.

*Here is my list of what I would like in my little beauty bag:*

* **Regular Black Mascara**
   * (*Previous product:* Thrive Causemetics Liquid Lash Extensions Mascara… I was gifted this and I quite liked it.) — I like that it doesn’t smear. I have hooded eyes so my lashes smear super bad if they’re not a tubing or waterproof formula…
* **Eyebrow Pencil**
   * (*Previous product:* NYX Eyebrow Powder Pencil) — I prefer pencils not brushes…
* **Liquid Eyeliner**\- (*Previous product:* Stila micro-tip) — also another product I really liked. But open to anything easy to apply.
* **Eye primer**
   * (*Previous product*: Urban Decay eyeshadow Primer Potion) — I just need to keep my wings in place bc I touch my face a lot.
* **Shimmery Bronzey Eye Pencil**
   * (*Previous product*: some random Covergirl pencil) — more for basic every day look.
* **Shimmery Bronzey-Goldy Eyeshadow Palette**
   * (*Previous Product:* IDK!) — I just really like a nice subtle nude-ish shimmer and but also similar lighter and darker tones.
* **Fun Summery BRIGHT Eyeshadows**
   * (*Previous Product*: Kimchi Cosmetics, forget the name, but think fun disco Aqua and very bright yellows and greens.) — I only do this once in a while but I love it…
* **Blush**
   * (*Previous Products*: Pixi tinted moisture stick / an ancient MAC pot) — If I wear any makeup I go for blush first. It makes me look alive so I’d love to get a good one.
* **Is there anything I’m forgetting?**

Thank you if you read through all of that. Those are the bare necessities that I need. That being said, since you’re here… Here are my “nice to haves”

&#x200B;

* F**un colored ACTUALLY PIGMENTED mascaras**
   * Similar to above, I’ll do a funky look SOMETIMES. I love blue and green and purple mascaras but I’ve been so disappointed in the few that I bought in recent years. I hate buying them and then they’re just… not even remotely clockable as blue or purple. I want VIVID!
* **SPF Setting Spray**
   * I don’t wear foundation so I usually just put on SPF underneath, but it’d be nice to have it be a LAST STEP instead of the first step. I’m very interested in the “Vacation” brand. It’s very much a “that’s so me” vibe but I don’t wanna buy into the hype unless someone sells me on it.
* **Tinted SPF moisturizer or similar.**
   * I’m white but kinda olive-ish. I’ll never be a full coverage girly but I could probably use a little bit of light-weight concealer.
* **White pencil eyeliner**
   * idk I heard it’s coming back into fashion.
* **ONE general face cleanser**
   * I have other things for skincare but I would like to have a holy grail face cleanser. I always kinda liked Cerave but lately… idk I feel like I should upgrade.
* **Orange Blossom or Jasmine scented fragrance**
   * I love floral scents. Vanilla, sugar-y scents are not for me. Clean, floral, fresh. Hints of citrus acceptable.

It’s just makeup I’m a bit clueless about.)

What are your favorite primers, foundations, setting sprays or powders, concealers, blushes, etc.?  Are creme or powder products better? How do I know if a product is silicon/oil/water/etc. based?  And which kinds should not be used together? 

I bought the ilia super serum because it was recommended to me, but I’m not sure if i like it… it kinda has a weird smell. I do like how sheer and natural it is (since my skin is in good shape, i don’t need too much coverage) and i love that it has an SPF, but it makes me look greasy. (I know it’s supposed to be dewy, but it’s a bit too much.) I didn’t want to toss it so I went back and got a mattifying primer for underneath.. it immediately went patchy looking.  So I went back again and got a setting powder but then it made me look cakey.  I’m just at a loss.. Is there another foundation that’s better or one that i can mix it with to tone down the shininess and maybe slightly increase the coverage? How can i tell if they’ll be compatible? I don’t want them to separate or turn flaky on my skin if i mix them..

I definitely believe in higher quality products so i don’t mind spending money if they’re worth it. I would just rather not waste money on products that end up not working.

1712108331.0,"What do you recommend for a dewy glowy natural look? I have very dry and sensitive skin, so it’s hard to look well-hydrated and glowing.

Aside from moisturizer and primer, I use liquid foundation (medium coverage) or tinted moisturizer, blush (it’s a cream), sometimes highlighter (also a cream), and either a setting spray or powder (it’s not more glowy with one versus the other - it looks the same).

Any holy grails for someone with really dry skin that wants to look dewy and glowing?

 I am looking for a new full coverage foundation. I was just wondering if anyone had any recommendations? Previously, I was using tarte- their face tape liquid and also their Amazonian clay cream type foundation, which I absolutely loved. It made my skin look so beautiful. It is definitely full coverage but didn’t feel full coverage, if that makes sense. and hardly transferred . Unfortunately, I just was having trouble finding the correct shade with them because I am very fair, and they tend to run kind of orangey so I switched to Mac and the color match is SO good (NW10) but I do not like the way it sits on my skin and it transfers a lot too. Looking for something that’s full coverage that will make my skin feel very soft and smooth, not sticky, and is transfer resistant. Prefer matte over dewy but it’s not a deal breaker

1711939690.0,Help! Wedding makeup failing me ,"I am in a bit of a crisis as I am 5 days out from my wedding and my wedding makeup is starting to fail me!! 

For clarity - I am doing my own makeup. 

I have been practicing my wedding makeup using foundation brushes for my foundation application and it’s been great (stippling it on and then buffing to blend it out a bit). 

But, for some reason, this weekend in my final practice rounds before my wedding Friday, the foundation is getting all splotchy and patchy looking. I have changed nothing in my process. 

So after the first fail, I started to test different primers and moisturizers to see if they would impact it, but all my primers are now making it look worse, so now I’m just sticking with moisturizer. 

I then tried using a damp makeup sponge, that was better but not great. 

Then in a last ditch effort of frustration, I slathered it on with my fingers and oh my god it worked better than it ever has. I used the damp sponge to blend out some spots, but after a day of wear it looks great still and I am baffled. 

Am I crazy for using my fingers to apply foundation??? 

Am I messing something up with the brushes all of a sudden? 

Is it my products just not working for my face anymore?

The ordinary moisturizer 
Il Makiage foundation 
Maybeline instance age rewind eraser concealer for under eye color correction

I found a super cool video on YouTube that showed me how to find out my color season by analyzing my skin, eye, and hair color (turns out I’m an Autumn). I did some more digging and found that warmer colors suit me best (deep oranges, mustard yellow, warm greens, rich browns, etc.) the eyeshadow palette I have is probably over a decade old and has lots of colors that I never use and knowing the color palette I should have now, I’m hoping you guys could give me some suggestions on eyeshadow palettes that have as many fall colors as possible. A wide range of colors on the palette is preferred so I don’t have to spend so much buying multiple sets.

I know make up can be expensive and I don’t wear eyeshadow much so I’m willing to spend a decent amount if it’s good quality and has a range of colors. I don’t know how much exactly make up costs but I wouldn’t be opposed to spending around $80 for a big palette. Again, I don’t want to wear too much make up at a time as I like a bit more natural (light coverage foundation, maybe some blush and highlighter and that’s usually it), but if there’s anything else you think would be good to get that’s not a lot of work, please let me know!",MakeupAddiction

My concealer that I use is the dior forever skin correct and I love it. It’s water based so im preferably looking for a water based foundation. I am aware that silicone based is better for oily skin so I could do that too, I can make it work.

My preference is medium/light coverage. However, I probably won’t be wearing it that often so good go for medium-full for occasions and sheer it out when I want to.

Price point is not too much of an issue, have been looking at lancome tient idole but people say the reformulation is bad :(

if you have any advice for skincare or makeup products that are good to begin i will really appreciate it (specially because i have no one to ask about these things)

I buy products that claim they are hydrating and then I put it on and an hour later my skin is like peeling. This has happened to me with the Dior lip oils (for how expensive they are they shouldn’t be making my lips feel like sandpaper). Even when I put on aquaphor I somehow wake up the next morning with lips that don’t seem hydrated AT ALL. Why does this happen I literally don’t get it🥲🥲,MakeupAddiction
