1712791398.0,[acne] hormonal acne after getting iud / stopping BC pill,"Hi 
I got an IUD 5ish months ago and have been breaking out horribly ever since along my chest, back, neck, jaw. I looked it up and this is all due to hormonal acne. I was on the birth control pill before the IUD so not sure if the breakouts are due to stopping the pill or starting the IUD.

I feel like I had a good and easy skincare routine before that was pretty simple - face rinse, AHA, moisturizer, and spf in the morning and cerave SA cleanser wash, retinol, moisturizer at night. 

When I started breaking out badly, I started using the cerave hydrating oil cleanser face wash every night because I saw good things online about it and switched to using the cerave SA cleaner every other day instead. This didn’t help and maybe even made my skin feel worse. It feels like I need to find an entirely new routine now. 

I had isolated breakouts before but nothing like now where I have entire areas of my body breaking out in dozens of big and small red pimples and closed comedones, which I only learned about after I started getting them a few months ago. None of it is cystic but it’s uncomfortable and unsightly. I know sometimes it takes years for people to find the right routine and it’s only been a few months for me but I’m just hoping to get my clear skin back! Any tips on how to manage this? ",1
1712790277.0,[Acne] Retinols burns,"Epiduo and retinol burns

I need help with my skin. It isn't tolerating any actives anymore. 
I have moderate acne and took one course of Accutane in 2019. The acne game back even worse. 2021 I was diagnosed with PCOS years after my cystic acne started thriving..

For several months after finishing accutane course, I was perscribed topical isotritinoin forever, which was going well until it was suddenly retrieved from all pharmacies in my country for about 6 months. I had no spare tubes so naturally I stopped. 
As soon as it was back in pharmacies I bought 0.025% and started slowly again exactly how I did first time. 2 weeks in my entire face started burning. Had to stop. 

Took a break until Oct 2023, focused on diet, lifestyle changes etc. which helped a little, but I needed an active to clear my skin. Went to another dermatologist and was perscribed epiduo. 

Started slowly, once a week then twice a week then every two nights then every other night. Last three days I experienced slight tingling which I brushed away as nothing for my skin was used to epiduo by then. Tonight was the thereshold, burning all over my face seconds after applying epiduo, I had to wash immediately and applied moisturiser while wet. The burning was still there, so I washed my face with cold water and applied fucidin, a corticosteroid topical cream which I kept for emergencies. Burning was reduced now 20mins later, but still there. 

What do I do now ? Is it possible that my skin will never tolerate any actives again ? I was always told to keep it simple but cleanser, moistursier sunscreen never felt enough. 

I also have oily skin that gets clogged pores often so the only moisturiser I can use without getting new pimples is sensilis hydra essence. While it doesn't clog pores it doesn't feel like it is moisturising enough. 

Can anyone with experience / knowledge help please ? I'm desperate.",1

1712780481.0,[Acne] A kid told me acne happens due to hand touching face.,"Weird thing a kid told me when i was a kid too.

I was suffering with very rough acne when I was 13-14 and coincidentally that was puberty age and I was a normal boy. It's famous in my country that excessive masturbation causes acne but I couldn't find any scientific evidence so naturally denied it. A friend of mine who knew too much about many things compared to us told me that when you masturbate, bacteria stays on your hand that causes acne when it touches face and no matter how much you wash it, that bacteria will stay there for a week or two. I believed him and stopped touching my face and again coincidentally acne stopped after a while. That stuck with me and anytime I found my left hand near my face, I remembered it and removed my hand. I grew up and once when I thought about it, I knew 1000% that was fake because no way a bacteria like that can resist soap and stuff. But acne started again when I ignored hand on my face and this has happened quite a few times. I still find it very weird and avoid touching my face with left hand but another side of me know this is fake. Your thoughts?",1

About a year and a half ago a friend bought me some skincare products after I noticed a wrinkle on my forehead and freaked out. I was using the Cerave AM/PM/Hydrating Cleanser and an OTC retinol at night 3-4 times a week for the first year and then over the last 6ish months I substituted the OTC retinol for tretinoin from HIMS which is compounded (0.055% tret, 5% azalaic acid and 4% niacinimide) so now I do:  
  
AM:  
  
\- Just rinse my face with water and apply the Cerave AM  
  
PM:  
  
\- wash my face with Cerave Hydrating cleanser  
  
\- Put on Cerave PM  
  
\- Put on the compounded tret every other night

1712780394.0,[acne] [PSA] Beware the Winlevi withdrawal,"WINLEVI WITHDRAWAL story:

  
Hello! Now that my skin has finally recovered (1 year later) I feel that I need to share this with the internet. I experienced mild hormonal acne throughout my 20s. Never wanted to go on spiro, so when Winlevi came out I was super excited for a topical hormonal option. I used Winlevi cream morning and night on my cheeks and jaw as instructed. For the first 3 months my skin looked AMAZING! No pimples, all my pie vanished - truly perfect skin. But then... after month 3 I started getting breakouts again. I had read online that people had experiences with their skin going back to normal or getting worse on winlevi after 3 months, so I was nervous that Winlevi was making my skin worse. So I stopped applying it....

  
3 days later, all heck broke loose. I woke up and my skin was itchy, red, and dry. (only on my cheeks and chin/jaw - not my nose or forehead where I hadn't been applying the winlevi). I thought maybe I got a sunburn - although I hadn't been in the sun and I always wear sunscreen anyways. Over the next few weeks my skin barrier DETERIORATED. My skin was so sensitive that I couldn't even GET IT WET! It would flare up when I put ANY product on it. So not even any sunscreen, makeup, soothing anything. I got all new gentle Avene products and even that irritated it. I fell into a depression because I couldn't shower, go outside (no sunscreen) or really do anything because my face just HURT and ITCHED. Even the air hurt it from just taking a walk. And to top it all off, because of how irritated my skin was I got the WORSTE HORMONAL ACNE BREAKOUT OF MY LIFE! (I think I had never truley experienced full blown acne until this ordeal, omg) The scars it has left...oof. My skin barrier was just non-existant during this time. It was so dry, like soooo dry. 

  
I went to my derm and she just said: ""winlevi wouldn't do that, you should just continue to apply it"" - um no. After about 2 months of my skin being EXTREMELY reactive and also randomly flaring up in hives (only on my cheeks and chin) - it finally started to calm down. I would wash with only cold water - barely any face wash. It took forever to go back to normal - but eventually, after 6 months (!) I am kind of back to normal. I occasionally get a bit red if I take a shower that is too warm, but for the most part I can use my normal products again. 

  
When this was happening, I was just in survival mode. But now, looking back on it, IT WAS 100% SOME KIND OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE WINLEVI. I talked with my derm before using it to make sure it was not a steroid because I'm aware that TSW exists, and she assured me it wasn't. WELL - WINLEVI IS A STEROID! It's not the same type of steroid that is linked with TSW, but still.... I had all the symptoms that line up with TSW.   


PLEASE - if you had a similar experience with Winlevi please comment. And if you are using Winlevi and it's working for you - great - but just beware of what might happen when you stop. There was NO warning of any kind of withdrawal like this. If I had known this was a possibility I would never tried it.   


I have pictures of the entire process - I'm not super keep to share them with the internet but I can if people want. idk. It's kinda traumatic to look back at haha. 

  
TLDR: After using Winlevi cream for acne on my face for 3 months, I stopped using the cream and experienced withdrawal side effects similar to TSW. It took 6 months for my skin to fully heal. Please do not use this new cream - or if you do just know this is a possibility if you stop taking it!",1

Should I be using the soap with anything else cause right now I’m just using the soap and a moisturizer. 3. Since I’ve started, I’ve been keeping the soap on my face for one minute and 30 seconds and this is because I feel absolutely no tingle or burn when using black african soap so I was wondering if my tolerance is built from the panoxyl or what?

right now my routine consists of :

AM

Cerave foaming cleanser

I'm from mugwort essence

Isntree green tea emulsion or the Round lab birch juice moisturizer (lately more so the moisturizer since my skin has been feeling so rough and dehydrated)

Round lab Dokdo sunscreen 


PM

Cerave foaming cleanser 

I'm from mugwort essence or Cosrx propolis toner

Round lab birch juice moisturizer 

I also use the Cosrx blackhead power liquid once or twice a week, and when I do use it I use the Paula's choice BHA only on my nose area as I find it too strong to use anywhere else since I do have sensitive skin 

is there any product that would help, or anything I can do personally to make it better ?

1712775896.0,[Product question] Does switching from tret to a low strength retinol cause purging?,"I had to 'give up' my prescribed 0.25 tretinoin and clindamycin gel due to problems with obtaining this medication.

I made an immediate switch to cosrx 0.3 retinol cream a month ago, and I'm getting annoying whiteheads in my usual break out areas (chin and mouth).

1712775598.0,[Product Request] looking for a particular hand scrub or something similar ,"Apologies in advance, I know very little about skincare.  I’m trying to buy a gift for someone that deals with extremely dry hands.

A few years ago my wife and I were in Palm Springs.  We stopped in a store called sinfulicious and were offered a free sample of some kind of hand scrub.  They took us to these sinks in the back, and it was like a multi-step process of rinse / scrub / rinse / scrub.

For the next 2 days my hands felt softer, smoother and more moist than any human skin I’ve ever felt.  Even out there in the desert.  This stuff seemed like magic.

Unfortunately I live across the country and this store doesn’t seem to have a website or working phone number.  Does anyone have any idea what they put on our hands? Or does this sound similar to a product I could find at another store?

1712773814.0,[acne] sebaceous filaments poking out the skin,"So I have reasonably prominent sebaceous filaments on my nose. I don’t particularly mind how they look, since im the only one inspecting my face that close, but some of them are sort of poking out of my skin. It’s like they’re trying to just naturally shed out but they only get halfway. I can scrape the area very gently with a nail and they come out more but not completely (i do not do this often, i was just figuring out what was going on). Every time I go to cleanse my face or apply any step it feels gross. It’s especially bad in the corners of my nose, and does make that area look a little dry (even though it’s not). 

I’ve been focusing on hydration in that area and applying Vaseline even if I’m not slugging the rest of my face, and I do feel it helps a little but doesn’t stop it completely. I’m already oil cleansing, and I use tretinoin and azelaic acid so don’t want to (and shouldn’t need to) add any more actives to my routine.

 Does anyone have any advice? Should I just keep going with the hydration and see how it goes?

I don’t really have a routine ( I want to build a simple one though ) because I’ve never really had any skin issues other than ‘injury’ scars and I have pretty good genetics but I wash my face in the shower and use lotion then I try not to forget sunscreen and do pretty much the same at night.

1712770308.0,[Personal] Thank you for your time last night.,"Hi everyone. Yesterday night I posted and asked for help for my husbands facial acne issue. It was deleted because a mod said I was asking for medical advice…which I wasn’t, I thoroughly thought it was acne. 
Growing up, my husbands acne, were cysts and boils under the skin on his cheeks and he would have red skin…so it wasn’t out of the ordinary for us just different because it wasn’t going away quickly. 
Anyways, I wanted to say thank you so much to everyone who responded and gave us insight. If I hadn’t asked here, We may have never went to the doctor because it isn’t too far off from his acne as a teen and just kept trying different acne products. 
We went to urgent care today and it was indeed a staph infection. I wish my post wasn’t deleted because I always lurk on reddits and when I was looking for something similar to my husbands there was nothing out there. My post with everyone’s comments could have helped the next person who deals with something similar.
Oh well, thank you so much fellow skincare addicts!!

1712770234.0,[acne] Suddenly getting breakouts of whiteheads around mouth?,"Around 4 weeks ago I noticed I was having a bad breakout around my chin/lips. I assumed it was hormonal so gave it a week and assumed it would clear itself up. However it hasn’t fully gone away. I was getting anywhere from 1-5 new whiteheads a day. They are small and usually burst and heal within 2/3 days before new ones appear. I have no irritation at all or rash. I stopped using the most recent cream I bought incase it was clogging my pores, and have been focusing on double cleansing the area properly. Also bought a sls free toothpaste. This all helped and I was only getting the odd spot every other day after over 2 weeks of constant spots. However I’ve woke up today with 4 new whiteheads all around my lips. I understand virtually anything could cause this but I want to stress I have NEVER had an issue with my skin like this, even as a teenager I don’t recall having breakouts this long and severe. I don’t have any sensitivities to my knowledge. Any suggestions on what I could do?

1712760739.0,[Routine Help] advise on routine after severe irritation,"I am a male. My whole life never really had a skincare routine. It pretty much consisted of just washing my face with head and shoulders during a shower. I know… not great. I have acne all over my body, but really only care about acne on face and neck/scalp. Face isn’t too bad, but I breakout on my neck and scalp pretty bad and especially is embarrassing and hurts like hell when getting a haircut every 2 weeks.

Anyways, about 2 months ago I decided to finally have a skin care routine. I did some research and ended up on the following;

Cerave Renewing SA Cleanser 
Paula’s Choice 2% BHA 
Paula’s Choice Clear Extra Strength 5% Benzoil Peroxide 
Aruba Aloe Vitamin E (As moisturizer)

I slowly added each product until I was able to incorporate all of them for a whole month straight with no adverse effects, but definitely a great improvement on the skin. The routine was:

AM 
Cerave Renewing SA Cleanser 
Aruba Aloe Viramin E

PM 
Cerave Renewing SA cleanser 
Paula’s Choice 2% BHA 
Paula’s Choice Clear 
Aruba Aloe Vitamin E

I went on vacation. The airline lost my luggage and my all my products were in there. Thankfully it was found and sent to me 4 days later. I was excited to finally be able to use my products again. I did the PM routine and went to sleep. The following morning my entire face and neck was tomato red (keep in mind I have a darker complexion) and skin was really raised and irritated. It was hot to the touch and burned anytime it was touched, or exposure to the sun. Went to the pharmacy and they said all I could do is moisturize and apply SPF. Thankfully the next day it was a lot better and eventually went through the peeling phase. About a week later I was back to normal. I can’t attribute the irritation to the products or extreme sun exposure with no protection or combination of both.

I stopped using the 2% BHA and Benzoil peroxide and I’ve been fine so far in terms of irritation. However I’m starting to break out again and I want to go back applying the products, but I want to do it right this time around. Could I get advise on a routine or advise for the following products:

Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser or SA Cleanser

1712755227.0,[Misc] Need assistance with my hormonal acne.,"Hello everyone. I'm seeking for any suggestions you may have for how I can get rid of my acne.
 
 I visit a dermatologist often, and I've noticed improvements in my body acne but not so much in my hormonal acne lately. Spirono was 
 administered at 50 mg for the previous four months, and 100 mg for the most recent two. On my chin, I apply 0.025% Tretinoin from 
 skinorac once every day. I use gentle cleanser the other 40% of the time and facial cleansing wipes around 60% of the time. I just use 
 them at night, and in the morning I simply wash my face with water.
 
 I have a prescription from Curology for their ""Rich"" moisturizer, which I use every night before bed. It contains 2% azelaic acid, 1% 
 clindamycin phosphate, and 0.25 percent zinc pyrithione. I use the RoC retinol correction serum capsules following moisturizer. I 
 occasionally have a week or two of clear skin, followed by a sudden flare-up right before my period. After having relatively clear skin, I just 
 recently broke out again, which is why I'm asking for advice right now.",1

1712753905.0,[Acne] Sugar causing acne,"Hi!! I'm 16f and I've had acne (mostly on my forehead, and a little on my chin, but never on my cheeks) to at least some degree since I was 13. I've used a few products since my skin started breaking out and although I find they work well to manage breakouts (making them scar less, and heal quicker) they never actually stop my skin from forming acne. I have very fair sensitive combination skin, and it's something that really really bothers me, so I started researching how to actually prevent acne rather than curing it, and found that acne can be very linked to your diet. I noticed during my birthday week (back in February, I had several different birthday events and they all had cakes and pastries etc.) my skin had gotten really really bad, probably the worst it had ever been. I'm not the type of person to eat a ton of sugar since I don't really have a sweet tooth, so it never occurred to me that sugar could have been the cause of my acne. I had stopped eating sugary foods (But I still ate carbs like pasta bread etc,, I just made sure nothing had any added sugar to it) and any time I wanted something sweet I would eat fruit instead. My skin improved A LOT in this period, almost instantly clearing itself, and I kept avoiding sugar. I went on holiday for a few days and since I wanted to eat local pastries, I decided it was a good idea to test my theory, just to confirm what I thought, so I ate a bunch of pastries and waited to see the results. A few days after my skin broke out really badly, confirming my suspicions. Since, I've completely avoided anything that might have sugar in it, but I wanted to know:  
  
\-Is there a way to test specifically for a sugar intolerance relating to my skin  
  
\-Is there a way to cure my intolerance / eat sugar without breaking me out  
  
\-Is this something that could pass with age,, after puberty etc

1712751841.0,"[Routine Help] 33M New to skincare, need help refining my basic routine","Hi all!

First time poster--very new to even trying to care about skincare, but I bought a skincare set that I really enjoy using in the morning and evening, but I'm just having a little trouble refining the process.

Namely, I don't really know how much time I should put between each step because the instructions online really aren't clear. I'm not sure if I should wait for my skin to dry and each product to fully absorb into my skin before moving to the next product? Also unsure if I should use my amethyst face roller at the end of every single step, at the end of just the last step of each regiment or just the morning regiment? 


Right now this is my routine and roughly how I time it:

**MORNING:**

**In shower:** CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser

**Out of shower, once face is still slightly damp:** CeraVe Vitamin C Serum, followed by the amethyst face roller (from my freezer) for a few minutes

**About 15 minutes later:** CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream

**NIGHT:**

**Before bed:** CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser

**Right away, while skin is still damp:** CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment

**At the same time:** Apply Plump-kin Retinol hydrogel eye patches

**Watch something in bed for 15-20 minutes:** Remove eye patches and put on CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream

**Sleep**

So that's my whole routine. I'm just not sure if I should put more time between each step (or just time between the steps that I kind of do in tandem--my first two morning steps and my first two night steps) and how often I should use the face roller?",1

Doxycycline --> GI Issues

Hi all-- I started Doxy 2 weeks ago. I have cleared my cystic acne in the past holistically, through nutrition and hormone-balancing focused lifestyle changes, but it came back. My holistic nutritionist said that because ""acne is an injury"" and ""the body keeps score,"" one round of Doxy ought to knock it for good. 

I was apprehensive to start taking an antibiotic knowing the negative effects they play on overall GI health. I started taking a probiotic 1 week before I start Doxy to give me GI system an extra boost. 

2 weeks in, and I have never been so constipated in my life. I only saw on other Reddit posts that constipation is a rare side effect of Doxy -- well it is true and it is very unpleasant. I am drinking water, adding in extra fiber to my diet, along with taking a high quality probiotic.

I know it will subside once I am off Doxy, but wanted to let others know that it is a real symptom, albiet on the rarer side. Acne is such a struggle and so difficult to deal with every day, but I am hopeful this round of Doxy will clear it. 

Any tips on if I should taper off after my 3 month mark? Has anyone not weaned off and stopped outright?  ",1

1712727913.0,Super Sensitive Skin! [Routine Help]," 

Hi,
I swear it feels like l've never met anyone with skin as sensitive as mine, and I want to know if there's anyone out there who has been on the same road as me.

I'll provide a few bullet points about my skin. -Had a lot of cystic acne in my teenage years, surprisingly no acne scars. 
-Currently struggling with adult acne; larger pores/filaments along my nose and a bit of my cheek area. 
-I breakout on the apples of my cheeks, usually white heads filled with pus and regular ""red"" ones I guess.

Now, here's my skincare routine: I remove my makeup using micellar water and wash my face with warm water, then I use the Cetaphil moisturizer for dry skin.
It's alcohol free, non-comedogenic, and paraben free.

My skin tends to feel tight after I wash it, and I experience some flakiness around my nose, and no l don't use a cleanser. I tried oil cleansers as well and no luck, even la roche posay. I stuck to cream cleansers since l hear those are better for people with dry skin I'm gonna get a lot of crap for this but every cleanser I have used has broken me out, and I try to stick to it for months but it never gets better. I've used some korean brands such as COSRX, but the alcohol in it destroyed my face and made my skin feel even tighter even though it's a ""gentle cleanser"". 

Right now, I'm looking for a sunscreen for my skin, I purchased the cetaphil one since it's the only brand that had worked for me so far l; wore it yesterday and felt fine, but upon application today I felt a slight burning sensation, and by the time the evening came, I had a few whiteheads breakout along my cheeks again, and even a pimpl my ear which is so unusual and clearly points to a product causing an issue. I'm feeling kind of hopeless because everyone around me has already grown out of acne.

TLDR; I'm acne prone with dry and sensitive skin and out of the abundance of products out there, l've only found a moisturizer that doesn't break me out. I would at least like to find a sunscreen and a cleanser and I will be truly happy.

1712725227.0,[Acne] closed comodones from birth control or routine? Pls help!,"Hi,
I am 20F and white. I don’t know what to do anymore, my confidence has dropped. I used to be known as the one with porcelain doll skin but now my face is covered in tiny bumps (cc) that I can’t seem to get rid of. When I squeeze them they kinda smell weird (?) and I know they’re closed comodones bc of how deep they are (when I pop them my skin lowkey breaks). I was on “Yasmin” combo pill from January 2021 to May 2023, my skin went though a bit of a purge period but overall I was very happy with my skin. I switched to “Nextstellis” pill May 2023 to August 2023. I think I also introduced snail mucin around then. I now started “Lolo” pill January 2024 and am still on it. My skin started to become textured last summer but not really a noticeable amount to anyone. Now people are noticing, my good friend mentioned it to me the other day (with good intentions). This past school year has been stressful so that has not helped with my skin or routine because I’ve been inconsistent and changing up my products left and right. Also I know popping them is so bad but it’s addicting and I think it kinda helps..? I pop the left side of my face more and a lot of them are gone compared to the right which is completely covered in cc. I can’t think of anything else I do more on the right side of my face. Finally I’ve gone back to my normal routine which is:

AM:
Purity cleanser 
La Roche posay effaclar duo plus
Either cerave moisturizer or TO NMF + HA

PM:
Purity cleanser
TO 7% Glycolic acid
CORSX snail mucin
TO niacinimide serum
Centella green level eye cream  
Cerave night renewal cream

The main area of my cc are around my cheeks and jawline - it literally is almost every pore. My forehead is a different kind of texture, small blackheads kinda. My skin is normal, used to be oily for a second in the winter but now it stopped. I am looking for any help at all, please. I am in Ontario, Canada (& prefer budget friendly options). Pls share any tips! I appreciate it thank you!",1

1712722618.0,[REVIEW] I think I may have finally found a comparable dupe for the Caudalie Vinoperfect serum.,"

(35F, Caucasian, very dry skin, not acne prone at all, redness and dryness are my biggest concerns)  

So I absolutely adore the Caudalie Vinoperfect serum - and honestly, really everything by Caudalie. But as we know, the price (in the US) is absurd. Worth it, but absurd. I’ve been searching for a “dupe” for years, because paying $82 every 2 months for a serum hurts my heart.
One of the girls at Sephora recommended to me the Eadem Milk Marvel Dark Spot Serum with Niacinamide and I’ve been using it for about 2 months now, and I think it’s as close as I’ve come!

The Eadem Milk Marvel serum is still $68, so not much cheaper, but $20 is $20. I will say that I notice the same results that I get from the Caudalie serum; my skin is brighter, much less dull, much more hydrated, less redness, less dryness. I don’t really have any dark spots or acne scaring, so I can’t attest to it’s usage for that purpose. I do have some fine lines starting to form around my eyes/11’s, but they’re not too severe, and I use so many products that I’m not sure what is contributing to lessen the fine lines, but the Eadem serum may be helping with that as well.  

I figured I would provide my experience since I see so many posts looking for a dupe for the Caudalie.",1

I'm still getting new pimples at the same rate and feel like I'm in middle school again when i look in the mirror. and some of the acne really hurts, not sure if its just on a nerve or if its cystic, when i google cystic acne mine doesn't really look that bad.

1712721518.0,"[Routine Help] Moisturizer/Product Recs for Oily, Dehydrated, Sensitive Skin","Mostly as the title says. A lot of moisturizers are too heavy feeling for my skin. Using a thin layer will feel nice for maybe ten minutes and then my skin will feel incredibly dry after it's absorbed, but using a thicker layer or adding more after my skin feels dry results in a greasy feeling to my skin and then I break out. 

I've heard gel moisturizers are better for oily skin, but when I tried one I saw recommended often (Neutrogena HydroBoost) it worked perfect for a few weeks and then it just... stopped moisturizing. It kind of felt like putting aloe vera on a sunburn where it feels cooling for a bit and then a few moments later it just burns again.

I don't do anything to my skin in the morning. In the evening I cleanse with the First Aid Beauty Fragrance Free Face Cleanser, and am currently using the Innisfree Green Tea Seed Hyaluronic Acid Cream.

I'm probably going to keep using the Curology prescription service but all the basic products I'll need to swap out for cheapo drugstore stuff. I used Cerave in high school but I see people saying all sorts of bad things about it now which makes me anxious.

My skin is primarily dry; I do get minor breakouts but my skin never really feels oily. I can't say 100% but I believe I have mild rosacea. I'm 31 and have some mild forehead lines that were the anxiety tipping point that made me want to start doing this in the first place. My skin tends to be picky and react weirdly to things though this is a worse problem on my body than my face (chronic urticaria + extensive KP). 

Current routine:

AM: 

- No cleanser unless I sweat a particularly large amount the night before (or I fell asleep without washing the night before lol). Wash with water or use Quench Micro Water Complex Foaming Cleanser if needed

- If my face is feeling angry, Thayers Rose Petal Facial Mist. I've heard people disparage this stuff but it's literally the one non-prescription thing I have that I like. Feels like the moisturizer gets absorbed way better if I use this first and it makes my face feel super soft all by itself.

- Moisturizer: currently working through my tiny tube of Curology Cream Moisturizer which I like a lot but it's insanely expensive and I'm almost out after less than 2 weeks. After that runs out, I have Quench Micro Water Daily Glow Moisturizer.

- No sunscreen! Yes, I will change this lol 

PM (alternating days):

Day A:

- Cleanse w/ Quench Micro Water Complex Foaming Cleanser

- Moisturizer (Curology again, when that runs out Quench Micro Water Complex Night Relief Creme) 

- Wait 20 minutes, then apply a small amount of my Curology custom formula (tret, clindamycin phosphate, azelaic acid) along with some of my AM moisturizer

Haven't been the best about keeping sunscreen on my face in my early 20s but have gotten better about it over the past year. I have researched that these lines around my eyes could be due to dehydration. I will admit I have not been as strict as l was about a year ago with how much water I am in taking per day. I just wanted you guys opinion on this because for the past 2-3 months l've noticed these lines they have really been bothering me.

I live in Florida so plenty of sunlight here to go around. Please give me you guys your two sense.

Coming here because my latest dermatologist took a skin sample and diagnosed me with folliculitis after a lifetime of not knowing. But the treatment he prescribed didn't work. I've been on medication before and that helped but it caused my potassium levels to skyrocket. I tried acutane but my triglyceride count TRIPLED (apparently a side effect) and my dermatologist nearly triggered my eating disorder by demanding I cut ALL fats from my diet for the duration of treatment. 

I'm at my wits end. My skin has always scarred easily but the bumps, acne, clogged follicles, whatever, are constantly breaking out all over my back, neck, chest, shoulders, and upper arms. Now it's spread to my legs and started leaving scars. My ND stim is skin picking, but when my skin is clear I have no issues. I use Cln products (dermatologist recommended) but don't use body lotion because it makes me break out in white heads and pimples.

Does anyone know what this is, and what I can do? Seriously about to cry, I'm so sick of having hyperpigmentation scars all over my body - chest, back, legs, face, neck... I feel hideous. :(",1

The thing is, I feel a really bothersome tight feeling in my nasolabial folds, like the muscle is tense and it ks incredibly annoying. 
The other thing that also has me confused is the fact that when I push my inner cheek with my tongue, i can see that my nasolabial fold is red-ish in the area that the fold deepens (i hope that makes sense haha)

CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser, Moisturising Lotion and Hyaluronic Serum.

I started every two days when showering, now doing it daily as my skin has no irritation with SA. I stopped using the serum last week as the moisturizer has hyaluronic acid in it but now I feel my nose is visibly very oily at the end of the day. I'm probably only putting the cleanser on for 1-2 minutes.

I've been doing that for about a month and recently bought Clinique Take The Day off. Similar to the SA, I'm only leaving that on for about 1-2 minutes and rinsing with water. I do this at night before bed.

I know SA takes time, I think there is a slight improvement but photos almost look the same, it looks a bit better in person. It's as if they have gone from big, black dots to slightly smaller, almost grey looking. With the oil cleanser I feel like there's immediate improvement when it's done but looking in the mirror the following day it looks like it's back to normal. I wonder am I better off cleansing in the morning? Is once a night not enough? Should I leave each cleanser on for X amount of minutes?

I feel like I need a deep cleanse but I know people advise against the 10-15 minute oil cleanse once a week. I'm in Europe, I don't think SA is as strong here? Not sure if that matters. Tips appreciated!",1

I've been delving into the fascinating world of the skin microbiome and its critical role in our skin's health, immunity, and overall appearance. This complex ecosystem of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and mites works in harmony to protect us against pathogens, control inflammation, and even affect how our skin looks and feels.

Given the delicate balance of our skin's microbiome, I'm curious about the impact of various skincare products and routines. From cleansers and moisturizers to exfoliants and serums, every product we apply has the potential to disrupt or support this microbial community.

* **How do we choose products that support the health of our skin's microbiome?**
* **Are there specific ingredients or types of products we should avoid to prevent disrupting the microbiome balance?**
* **Can anyone share their experiences or changes they've noticed in their skin by focusing on microbiome-friendly skincare routines?**

So I am 17 years old about to turn 18. I’ve been back and forth with acne about 2 years I wanna say now. My start of my junior year I started breaking out like crazy which was suprising because I had never had acne before. I eventually went to a dermatologist because it got decent then came back even worse. I didn’t know what I was doing. Eventually I got prescribed, doxycycline to take once every day, tretinoin .05%, and a clindamycin lotion to use. I used that for about 3-4 months and my skin cleared up really good. I ended up getting about 3 sessions of microneedling done and my skin was looking great. I wasn’t getting anymore pimples and if I was they were really small and would go away fast. So I went the whole summer with clear and good skin until I got to the start of my senior year. I ended up getting hands foot and mouth disease from a teammate of mine. It all went away but after that I would say maybe 2 weeks after that I got one big nodule that I think just started it all back up again. I went back to the dermatologist and got prescribed the same stuff again. I wanna say this time it came back worse. I went through the whole 3-4 month process again with these pills. Everything cleared up but I would still have pimples that were deeper than last time pop out and it was concerning but I just kept doing what I was doing because they came and went really fast. Eventually I got back to microneedling because from the pills they left prettt bad scars that would make my face appear more red and looked like I had pimples when I didn’t so that was one of my first things to try and get done . I told my derma about the breakouts I would have so they upped my dosage of tretinoin to .1% and the gel version of clindyamycin. This is where I started to get more pimples. It’s been about week and a half since my last microneedling session where they also prescribed me my new stuff. Since I would use the Clindymaycin lotion as my lotion in the morning I have had troubles finding a lotion that doesn’t make my skin red. I used the vanicream daily facial moisturizer and the ceraave pm which I noticed made my face more red. Just last night I used the la rose posay triple repair cream which didnt make my face as red as the others. Right now I’m pretty  discouraged as face isn’t as bed as it was but it’s still breaking out  and it’s noticeable. I try to get a gallon of water in everyday which I’m. Prett good at doing. I also try to eat prettt clean. Idk what to do should I wait it out see how my skin does till my next microneedling session. I have been trying to stay away from accutane but is it something I should consider now? I also just got spearmint tea which I read could help hormonal acne.

1712644463.0,[acne] Breakout from LRP ciciplast b5 balm,"Hi Even though I was having a lot of red scars before this around my mouth, it broke out a lot after applying the ciciplast. (Ps. I also tried slugging with vaseline for 4 days and my skin took it very well, had a healthy skin for my dry face. It didn’t break out once. Maybe it took 4 days for vaseline to break me out I am not sure. What I am sure is it all came out the night after I applied ciciplast b5 balm).
My question right now is how to get rid of these without scarring and Can I use one last tube of retinoid cream before my order of tretinoin 0.025% arrive for one month? I am afraid my skin is gonna break out after using this retinoid and then again after changing to 0.025% tretinoin. 
I am not trying to get the drug without prescription
I also have one and the product is taking long to ship thats why i wonder if my retinoid cream and tretinoin are the same.

1712635190.0,[routine help] Did I do this right!? Embarking on routine journey for the first time.,"I am 39f and have never really had a skincare routine in my life besides rubbing my face with plain water in the shower, throwing on whatever moisturizer is at hand in the mornings, and occasional sunscreen. I have not really had any skin issues besides dryness and anxiety-induced skin picking.

I have started to notice some dark spots and uneven skin tone as well as larger pores and some dry spots/flaking (esp where i have picked) I don’t know if it’s aging, the skin picking, the sun or dehydration.

I made some quick purchases that claim to tackle my current concerns:

1. Moisturizing
2. Dark spots/uneven skin tone
3. Minimizing pores 
4. Anti - aging/ wrinkle prevention (I’m hitting 40)
5. SPF protection.

How did I do with the products I have chosen below?? Please help me with my starter routine— is it a good product? Is there a better alternative? Is there a step I missed in the routine? Any must-have ingredients I should incorporate ?

I did not purchase any luxury products since I  am just starting this journey. The options are overwhelming and I was scared to splurge on things I just don’t understand. But here are the products:

Cleanser : Cerave Hydrating Cream to foam cleanser (for the ceramides, hyaloronic acid, and amino acids.

Toner: Bliss Disappearing Act Niacinamide + Pore Vanish Toner ( for pore minimizing, green tea and mushroom extract)

Treatment: Curology Dark Spot Serum (niacinamide, glycolic acid, tranexamic acid, kojic acid and licorice root extract.

Moisturizer: Remedial Pax Day and Night Retinol and Collagen Moisturizer Face Cream (viral on tik tok, retinol for wrinkles, collagen, hyaloronic acid 5%)

SPF: AHC Natural Perfection Fresh Sun Stick (spf 50 and PA++++…whatever that is)

Any insight from those of you with much more experience than me is highly appreciated.

I seem to be missing vitamin C and peptides from this routine, which seem like generally recommend ingredients. Not sure if I can skip them or replace a product above with one that incorporates them.",1
1712683117.0,How’s my routine? [Routine help],"These are all of the skincare products I have, I only listed the ingredients that stand out based on my very limited skincare knowledge. 
Nocxema Pads (2% salicylic acid)
Aquaphor (41% petrolatum)
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (hyaluronic acid, glycerin, petrolatum, NP, AP, & EOP ceramides)
CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser (salicylic acid, glycerin, niacinimide, NP ceramide, hyaluronic acid, vitamin D)
CeraCe Foaming Facial Cleanser
(Niacinimide, AP, NP, EOP ceramides)
Vaseline cocoaglow Intensive Care Moisturizer (Petrolatum, glycerin)
L’Oreal Revitalift (10% glycolic acid)
Benzoyl Perocide Gel 10%
Niacinimide bubble things
Hyaluronic acid bubble things

Normally, I’ll wash my face with either CeraVe cleanser (depending on how oily my skin is) and use a niacinimide bubble and a hyaluronic acid bubble at night and leave my face alone in the morning. If I get pimples I use benzoyl peroxide cream gel on it at night, and hydrocolloid patches in the morning. 

I was wondering how I could implement other products or restructure my skincare routine. As far as things that may impact your advice goes, I’m 17F with dry, flaky skin (except for a few areas that can be very oily), I don’t get periods often, and I wear makeup most days.

1712679864.0,"[Misc] Battle of the tatcha dupes!  Purito, Indeed Labs and Brandefy.  Help me choose!","I have my eye on the tatcha “the essence.”  It is comprised ~98% of fermented rice, fermented green tea and fermented algae.  This checks a lot of boxes for me as I always need a green tea toner in my routine for red light therapy and sake is allegedly good for hyperpigmentation, which I have.  However it’s soooo expensive and reviews have convinced me it’s not worth all that money.

The purito 94 fermentation essence has 94% of fermented rice and fermented green tea.  No fermented algae but it has a TON of other goodies instead - botanicals and plant extracts that are nice to have.  Also it’s ~$11 for 5 ounces.  Tatcha costs 10x that amount!

The indeed labs microbiome essence has fermented rice and fermented green tea, albeit in unspecified concentrations.  It also has a bunch of fermented mushroom ingredients which are allegedly good for hyperpigmentation, as well as a ton of other goodies such as amino acids (which I love).  It is $25 for 3 ounces.  More expensive than the purito but still a fraction of the cost of the tatcha.

Brandefy does not have a dupe of this essence but I wanted to include them so anyone who reads this post knows that they have a dupe of the tatcha water cream!

Can anyone help me choose?  I’m leaning toward purito because it’s cheaper and states the concentration of fermented actives, which I like.  But I can definitely be convinced to go with the indeed labs!

1712652126.0,[Routine Help] Seeking Advice for My Skincare Routine. Help me to evaluate it.,"Hello everyone,

---- Background ----

I've been a silent observer, lurking on this sub for quite some time now. Today I've finally posted to seek your help in evaluating my current skincare routine.

Some background information: I'm a 22-year-old male who has been grappling with moderate to severe acne for about a decade, spanning most of my teenage years. My struggles have included phases of cystic acne, blackheads, and inflamed red skin.

Despite the challenges, I've opted for lighter solutions rather than stronger medications like Accutane. Currently, I'd say my skin has improved overall and my acne has highly diminished, though my skin tends to be oily and slightly sensitive.

I still have to deal with occasional acne, red spots, blackheads, as well as noticeable sebaceous filaments and acne scars on my cheeks.

--- The Routine ----

I've attempted to develop a logical skincare routine, incorporating the basics recommended by this reddit community (The Sca routine)  along with active products that have suited me during trial runs.

In my country (not the U.S), obtaining an appointment with a dermatologist is very challenging, with wait times ranging from six months to a year.

Thus, in the meantime, I've taken it upon myself to educate myself through online resources like this sub and have also obtained some prescribed medications from my general doctor.

I've created this skincare routine that I have been following for a couple of months now with good results when I have been consistent with it. No big acne flare ups or irritation.

I'll soon be incorporating Benzoyl peroxide and Doxycycline into my routine, in addition to my basic regimen.

I've added the BP to my routine builder (in the picture), it might me important to you to precise that it is 5% concentration and also leave on. I live in Europe If that's also of any importance.

Here is an overview of my current routine. I would greatly appreciate any feedback and advice you may have. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

I’m a real rusher in general and anything extra that I have to do always ends up pissing me off. I decided to start some skincare stuff back in January as I got some great gifts for Christmas and I’ve been worrying about wrinkles etc. I’ve been doing it since then, so I’m now using toner, spf, retinol, and some other serums and stuff but a couple of those have run out and I’ve decided I’m going to keep it simple whilst still using spf and retinol and the basics such as cleanser and moisturiser. But anyway, my point I’m getting to is; I hate doing it. Before now I just used to cleanse and moisturise and even then I’d be slapping that moisture on to get it over with. The last week I’ve dropped back to my old ways and last night all I did was my old cleanse and moisturise.

I’m just wondering if anyone else feels the same? Or am I just lazy? I really want to help my skin as I age so I do know that I need to keep it up, and I will, I’ll just definitely struggle a little. Back on it tonight!

This is a bit of a long post & it’s also extremely embarrassing for me but oh well, I need the help. Before October 2023, my skin had always been perfect& blemish free. I’d get the occasional hormonal or period-induced pimples but they would go away on their own after a few days. It’s also important to note that I had never really consistently used any skincare products aside from sunscreen & and moisturizer. This was up until about October 2023 when I started using a concealer that I guess I was unknowingly sensitive to which  caused me to break out BADLY. I would wake up to whiteheads and pustules every day after using it the day before and I was very annoyed because I wasn’t used to this. I then started picking away at these pimples and this resulted in dark spots. I was looking for a quick fix and someone recommended the salicylic acid wash from Cerave and I went ahead and got it and started using it EVERYDAY , in the AM and the PM !!! (very foolish to say the least). I guess I damaged my skin barrier and I started breaking out even more, especially on my cheeks and forehead and everytime these pimples went away or I picked at them, they left EXTREMELY dark spots. On top of that, around November or December I developed what I think is cystic acne  and it triggered my dermatillomania and I started poking holes in the bumps with a razor to be able to squeeze the goo out. If I was not picking away at those bumps and pustules, I was picking away at the scabs that were left behind. It’s been 5 months since the breakout that ruined my life happened but my skin just keeps getting worse and worse (because of my inability to stop picking at my skin and maybe the products I use idfk). I’ve introduced and removed so many products to my routine but nothing works. I’ve changed my diet a trillion times and still NOTHING works. My skin is ruined and it’s all my fault. I can’t step out without makeup now lol.This may seem dramatic to some but I have genuinely come very close to killing myself over my skin. I’m beyond depressed, I’ve completely isolated myself from friends and regularly skip classes if I’m having a particularly horrible skin day, which has ruined a few grades this semester. There’s currently a huge shortage of dermatologists where I live and the waitlists are genuinely crazy.. like 8 months-2 years, so I can’t even go see a professional. Has anyone else ever had skin this horrible and would you be able to recommend a course of action or products that helped? Here’s what I currently use on& off

AM:
- dove bar soap or just water
- la roche posay ultra fluid spf 50+ 
- glossier priming moisturizer balance
- la roche posay acne treatment 

PM:
- sephora makeup wipes
- dove bar soap or salicylic acid wash
- topicals faded serum (3-4 times a week)
- cerave moisturizing cream
- snail mucin
- la roche posay acne treatment 
- laneige cica sleeping mask
- divine essence carrot oil extract (idk someone told me to use this) 
 
Since I have never really had to worry about my skin type and skincare products, I’m unsure what ingredients to look for and which ones to avoid because Idk what ingredients in the concealer even made me break out in the first place. I’m just really desperate tbh lol all and any advice is appreciated thanks :(",1

I recently asked my friend to give me some skincare products since i wanna fix my face and so i want to know if these 4 products are good and if im going them in the right order.

So i first wash my face and dry it with a towel and then i use an oil cleanser on my face for like a minute and then i add a little bit of water on my hands to kinda activate the product i think (according to tiktoks they say its mandatory) after this i wash it off with warm water and pat my face dry. And the product i use for this is “ANUA pore control cleansing oil” 

After i do that i use “ANUA pore deep cleansing foam” for another minute and before i put it on my face i make sure to rub it so it looks foamy. After this i wash my fave with warm water and pat dry it once more.

After this i use the “watermelon glow pore tight toner” from glow recipe and spread it on my face. After that i use the “strawberry smooth clarifying and retexturing pore minimizer and hidrating face serum.


Now i think im using the last 2 products in the wrong order but i dont know if i am so im asking yall if its good or not. Please tell me if i should do something different or if im doing something wrong",1
1712642396.0,[Acne] retinol confusion ,"Ok so I'm 14 and I had like mid level acne, never large sores or super painful stuff, but a lot of blackheads and red skin.

(I stopped using it because it was making me turn crimson red when I used my moisturizer) I still haven't used it but my acne got worse today and I'm not sure if it was due to me not using retinol, or due to me just having a breakout.

1712641789.0,[Routine Help] My skincare routine: good or too much?,"I'm 25F- turning 26, normal skin and not prone to breakout/acne. I have these little bumps on T-zone (assuming they are clogged pores or whiteheads) since I was 10. Used to do a lot of exercise when I was younger so I'm guessing it's from all the sweating. I'm a sweaty person in general. And now I'm noticing there's MORE of those tiny bumps under my eyeglasses's rubber nosepad.

I purchased my skincare based on moods and the urge to try new products (I know..) so they may or may not go well with each other. However, my skin isn't very picky so I haven't picked up any changes or abnormality.

Currently my skincare routine goes like this by steps. Note I only do my routine at night.

1. Cleanser: Corsx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser
2. Essence: Corsx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence
3. Serum: IUnik Propolis Vitamin Synergy Serum
4. The Retinol 0.1 Cream (Just bought and introduced this to my face last night: 1 time usage up to date!)
5. Cream: HADA LABO Premium Hydrating Cream

What do you think of this skincare routine?

1712634408.0,[Routine Help] Keratosis Pilaris,"I started actively treating my KP recently with chemical exfoliants, but it’s worse than ever now!! I’ve tried the Peach slices salicylic acid toner for 3wks which just increased the amount of bumps and redness to no end. Then I switched to glycolic acid which would calm it down sometimes but my KP would still flare up with bumps. 

The reason why I think it has to be these exfoliants is because the KP has since spread to the areas where I put the exfoliants. I should also mention that I use the Naturium salicylic acid body wash, but nothing works :(

Has anyone else been in a situation like mine and what did you turn to? TIA

1712632502.0,[misc] why can't i use salicylic acid or sulfur with differin?,"so this is something i'm really confused about, you can use benzoyl peroxide with differin, but not salicylic acid or sulfur? 
and i'm not talking about layering these products, or even using them on the same day, just using them in your routine at the same time. 
from what i understand, it's because those ingredients are potentially irritating and drying and so is differin so they shouldn't be used together, but BP is also irritating and drying so?? and sulfur specifically is considered way more gentle than BP or SA. 
it's frustrating, because i've never tried BP, and my skin really likes SA and sulfur. 
i just hate to have to take the risk with BP on my sensitive skin just because i'm using differin now.

1712626155.0,PSA: be careful with hyaluronic acid !!! [PSA],"(None of this is medical advice, I am not a doctor, this is just my personal experience and I wish I saw this when I was on this subreddit. Please talk to ur doctor before doing anything with your skin :))

Hey guys! I used to be one of those people with mild acne and no skincare routine, so I decided to start a skincare routine to fix it. That was quite literally the worst mistake ever. 

I tried tretinoin for 6 months, and it turned my mild acne into severe. My skin also got extremely dry, so I was compensating with hylaluronic acid (HA). Nothing was working, so I cut out the tretinoin. After 3 months off the tret, my skin was getting dryer and dryer. So, I cut out all active ingredients except for HA, yet my skin was just getting worse. 

Finally, I found a tik tok that said that for some people, using HA can dry out the skin and make acne worse. Therefore, I stopped using HA, and immediately my skin got 70% better. Rarely any more new pimples, and my skin has stopped being dry. This was a month ago and my skin has stayed better. 

Is my skin completely clear ? Nope. Am I still going on accutane to cure it once and for all? Yes. But I think I could’ve avoided all of this if I didn’t ruin my skin barrier so long with tret and HA. So if you have incorporated those, and your skin is freaking out for more than 4-6 weeks, consider speaking with ur dermatologist and stopping before it’s too late and you have to go on accutane like me lol.

The chemicals were way too harsh for me and I begged my parents to put me on acutane but they wouldn’t. And I’m glad! I started to use curology instead which got my skin under control but I was still getting breakouts. I have finally found a routine that works well, it’s very simple but I’ve found what works best for me. I’ve always had very oily skin but now I know that it was producing excess oil because it was too dry! 

AM:
• rinse with water
• moisturize with Björns Royal Jelly Face Cream
• apply sunscreen, I use Björns 30 SPF mineral sunscreen 

PM:
• rinse with water
• oil cleanse with rose hip oil 
• Björns face cream 

If I’m breaking out I use African Black soap, but using that every day dries out my skin too much. Occasionally i will use the Aztec Indian Healing Clay mask and I also use pimple patches for small breakouts. After a workout I drink Vital Proteins collagen powder. I hope anyone who sees this and relates to the first picture knows that there is light at the end of the tunnel!! I never thought my skin could get to where it is today. I encourage everyone to try out more natural and gentle skin care methods:)

1712598022.0,[Product Question] Using a Niacinamide/Lactic Acid Serum with Azelaic Acid?,"Can a Niacinamide/Lactic Acid serum be used while using Azelaic Acid 15%? If so, where would it go in a routine?

For context, I used to be on Spironolactone, Tazarotene cream, First Aid Beauty's Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration for AM, Cerave PM Moisturizer for PM, and La Roche Posay's Vitamin C serum. When I voiced to my dermatologist about plans to start a family, she had me stop ALL of those products. The prescriptions and the Vitamin C serum (it has salicylic acid), I understand. But I don't understand why I needed to stop the FAB and Cerave PM moisturizers. Regardless, I weaned myself off of them gradually, but now that I am pregnant and no longer on those products, I am TERRIBLY broken out, my skintone is uneven, and my pores are larger and are appearing more on my cheeks, not just the usual problem area being my nose.

I am currently just cleansing with Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleaner and following it with either Neutrogena Hydroboost in the AM, and Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion in the PM. My dermatologist just prescribed Azelaic Acid 15%, so I started using it every other night after my moisturizer to try to get my skin adjusted to it. I was eyeing [Sephora's Niacinamide/Lactic Acid serum](https://www.sephora.com/product/gentle-peeling-serum-P509318?skuId=2693448&icid2=products%20grid:p509318:product), because it is pregnancy safe and seems it could help with my skin concerns. Is it redundant to use that if I am using Azelaic Acid, or does it address concerns that Azelaic does not cover? Would it just be used daily prior to moisturizer in the morning?

Also, any other pregnancy-safe products would be greatly appreciated!",1
1712597727.0,[Personal] I'm so frustrated with contradicting reviews and lack of trustworthy research.,"Hi all,

This is just a rant. I've been trying to set myself up with a routine for three years now. It has been so frustrating. I'm 27, have PIE, uneven skin tone and a couple of wrinkles and I've been on a tight budget. I have tried retinol, vitamin C, AHA, alpha arbutin, and azleic acid in addition to my usual sunscreen, moisturizer and cleanser. I have never seen results. Each time I start a routine, I keep going for 2-3 months and then come across something online that tells me I'm doing it wrong. Then, I get disappointed and give up for a while. The latest one was reading about product degradation. sounds like I should throw away everything I have and buy a whole new set of products. So, again I'll go into the rabbit hole of the internet telling me everything is bad and nothing will work. Also, an influencer derm said I shouldn't have been putting retinol on my smile lines. So, what the hell am I supposed to do for those wrinkles? This is so frustrating. I wish there was a single OTC product (not ingredient) that was super well-researched by unbiased parties that I could just stick to.

Anyway, thanks for reading my rant. Any tips or encouragements are welcome.",1

I don't really have acne anymore, i know i have big closed comedones on my left temple, right cheek and i also have a couple on my forehead. However, my forehead is full lf small bumps (really small) they are so small i can't even try and squeeze them. Something strange happens to my face during the day:  i wake up, i cleanse, i put sunscreen on. No matter what products i use, a couple hours after doing my skincare, or even if i don't do my routine at all, my skin FLARES up.

Every single of those tiny bumps i have on my forehead get super visible, my skin gets very red, it looks angry, all my pores enlarge and get super oily. I don't have any symptoms of a broen skin barrier, i moisturize daily, my products are ""non-comedogenic"", i have no allergies. 

  
Another thing is that my skin texture never ever really changes, no matter what i use. I'm on tret, i've been before, this problem is here since forever, i've tried peels, barrier repairing, everything. Texture isn't a problem actually anymore for me, i just wonder why my skin looks so bad during the day, and after i wash my face in the evening it looks great again (only to flare up a couple of hours later, especially if i moisturise). It happens even when i'm not stressed or anxious (you don't wanna see how i look then)

I have been dealing with this for about two years, I think this started because  I used to tear off my hangnails and remove my cuticle, that's not the case anymore.

I wash my hands ""A lot"" (Dove original because its ""mild""), before eating, after eating, after cleaning, after using the bathroom, after coming from the work/street, for me its normal hygiene. I wash dishes with gloves.

After washing my hands, I dry them with a towel and after a few minutes I moisture them with CeraVe (Moisturising lotion / the blue one), this prevented the hangnails from appearing but didn't solved the redness or swelling at all.

Sometimes my nails split, always on the sides, like ""hangnail effect"" but instead of skin they are nail fragments

Before going to bed I apply Neosporin ointment, the left hand seems to be SLOWLY improving but the right hand seems to be getting worst. This is already getting into my nerve, please help. I live in US (for products recommendations).

Today, I went to a demartologist and she basically said my skincare routine was way too much and irritating for my skin.

I was surprised as I specifically chose stuff that weren’t irritating. I stopped the pill two months ago so I bought a new routine to prevent acne and it worked relatively well except for hormonal acne.  

Here is my skincare and what she told me to stop : 

- Double cleansing with oil (Beauty of Joseon) and then, water-based cleanser (Abib acne foam). She told me to stop the oil.
- Soothing heartleaf toner > told me to stop it.
- Nail mucin essence > told me to stop it.
- Pink serum for skin barrier, the ordinary > told me to stop it and use a zinc + niacinamide serum. 
- Centella asiatica probio-cica cream > ok.

I also use a sunscreen when I go out which seems ok.

Hi! I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but it also felt out of place on [](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/), so I'm rolling the dice.

I got Ipsy bags from 2015 to about 2017. During that time, I once got a hand lotion sample in my Ipsy bag that was lemon-scented. The graphic design of the lotion tube was similar to the J.R. Watkins lemon hand cream, but had a bit more 'flair' as I would call it, more black curly line accents and flowers. The tube itself resembled a paint tube, with the cap being skinny at the base and the top of the cap being a wide flat disk.

The hand cream itself smells just like if Girl Scout Lemonaids cookies and a bakery had a baby. Whenever I had the lotion on, people would come to my office and comment how delicious and incredible it smelled in there. It was sort of thicker in viscosity, and it never left an unpleasant oily feeling on my hands. I don't know why I ever let this lotion go without replacing it, but now I'm looking everywhere and trying every keyword to no avail. If anyone can help me find it, I would be eternally grateful.",1

It's still burning a bit and I'm putting aloe vera on as I go but please don't make my mistake 😭. 

Always wait a few hours so the chilli stops being as harsh and wash and double wash your hands and mouth until it's got no chance of spreading chilli on your face. 

If anyone's done this before and has any tips other than aloe vera and milk it would be greatly appreciated...",1

Doing my night time routine first means that the product I apply may get washed away. However, showering first is bad for the skin, right?

 I’ve thought about doing the routine in two sections : remove makeup and maybe double cleanse before showering, then continue after but I’m just worried that my skin will feel dry during the shower, especially since it will be steamy.

Applying moisturiser before the shower seems a bit pointless since it’ll need to be washed away…  What are your thoughts on this or what is your routine like for this type of encounter? ",1

I decided to share my own experience. I wasn't sure of the cause—whether it was external or internal—or if it could be resolved at all. Small, dark, patchy spots began appearing on my stomach area, spreading daily. Part of me thought it might be skin cancer.

To address the issue, I took several steps:
- I rewashed all my towels and bed sheets.
- I discontinued use of my new body wash (Olay), as I noticed the spots began appearing around the time I started using it.
- I applied an antibacterial spray (hydrochlorous acid, to be specific) to my stomach area daily.
- I used an African net and a sugar body scrub to exfoliate the dark patches.

After a month, the issue was resolved, and the marks disappeared completely. I strongly believe the body wash was the culprit, causing an allergic reaction.

If anyone is experiencing a similar problem or has questions, feel free to ask.

1712534584.0,[Acne] Can I just be on like... A little birth control? ,"Tl;dr HRT for acne? 

Wondering if this is possible or something worth asking my derm about.

Basically, my skin has no acne on birth control. I used Yaz then Annovera. I wouldn't say it was great though because my skin was also horribly dry and would peel if I wore any makeup which was not the worst thing since my skin was pretty clear. However my libido was pretty low. 

Went off birth control and the acne came back (like I have an acne beard basically, total pizza face) and my skin is less dry, but still prone to peeling if I'm not very careful with what I use. So I have the acne and covering it is often super hard. But I don't want my libido to go away. I like sex, so it was like really enjoying cheesecake but never being in the mood for cheesecake. :(

I've had one appointment with a derm so far, and she prescribed spironolactone and tret. She was really excited about me starting spiro since she said I was a great candidate. However... Spiro gave me afib 😭 which sucked because I was really hopeful about it but I can't be messing around with my heart. I'd been on tret before (for several years... Like purging should have been long over) and it hasn't really done anything except make my skin really irritated even when doing all the techniques to reduce irritation (it was a Curology formula tho, so maybe one of the other actives was actually the problem, but Differin also does this to me).

But I KNOW the birth control worked and it didn't have any really concerning side effects (like the afib). Yaz and Annovera have ethynil estradiol in common.

1712533586.0,[Misc] My derm told me something that seems really weird...,"Before I say what it is, here is my routine in a simplified way:

AM - Cleanse, sunscreen  
PM - Cleanse, moisturize, hydroquinone 40mg/g + tretinoin 0.5mg/g + fluocinolone acetonide 0.1mg/g (3x week), adapalene 3mg + benzoyl peroxide 25mg (2x week)

The issue came when I told her I go to the gym in the AM and, since I have oily, acne prone skin, with a lot of redness (post-inflammatory erythema that gets even redder after working out), she said I should stick with the same routine and didn't need to cleanse after the gym, therefore, keep doing it before working out, and also not for a third time besides the first in the morning (which seemed like too much, but still).

Isn't this weird? Considering my situation, wouldn't it be just better if I removed the sweat after? She seems smart and well-studied but this made me feel a bit insecure about what to do.

1712533076.0,[Product Question] Can I mix Cerave AM and PM to make a better formula?,"Hey everyone. I’m a huge fan of CeraVe’s PM moisturizer and Moisturizing Lotion. I also enjoy using the AM moisturizer in the daytime, as i have dry skin and am also a pale redhead, and find sunscreen moisturizers to be convenient and protective. The only problem with the AM moisturizer is that i cannot apply it alone without it pilling on my face. To avoid this, I will pump about 2 pumps of PM moisturizer on then back of my hand, and then about 2-3 pumps of the AM, mix them together (think ""skincare smoothie"") and then i find it applies much smoother. I have been thinking about simply just mixing a bunch of the PM moisturizer into the AM jar.

Will combining products like that bugger up the sun- protectiveness of the AM moisturizer?

If it's not a good idea, what are some of yalls recommendations for good affordable sunscreen moisturizers? I break out easily (any oil containing product will cause breakouts), have quite dry skin, and am a 21 year old female.

It peaks before my period (horrible cystic acne) and then gets slightly better, but even now a week after my period I’m getting new whiteheads, the cystic acne has got a bit better but generally my skin texture is awful, so many small pimples and redness etc.

I had isotretinoin (Roaccutane) as a teenager as struggled with teenage acne which worked well and I didn’t have any acne between stopping that and starting on birth control a few years later.

My current routine: AM - Dermalogica precleanse, Dermalogica active cleanser, Dermalogica age bright clearing serum, Dermalogica active moist moisturiser, SPF50. PM -  the same as above but I also use Dermalogica microfoliant after cleansing and don’t use SPF.

1712474679.0,[routine help] What step to add gua sha!?,"
Hello!! 

I’ve been developing an evening skincare routine for some time and I landed on one I like. But now that I want to add gua sha to the routine, I’m not sure I’ve done so in the best way… but maybe I have! You tell me:

1. Paula’s Choice Foaming Cleanser
2. Paula’s Choice Toner (been trying a few different ones) 
3. The Ordinary Hyaluronic acid serum
4. First Aid Beauty Retinol 
5. Gua sha with rose hip seed oil!?!?
6. Kiehl’s facial moisturizer 

It feels wrong to put rose hip seed oil on my face after the retinol… like the oil would just strip that off. 

And it also feels wrong to then add more moisturizer over the oil after gua sha step.

Tonight is only my second night doing it this way but I welcome advice here before I keep going for too long! 

For the record, in the morning, I do the same steps, minus retinol or gua sha and I add spf before moisturizer.

TIA!

1712470441.0,[Product Question] Why are there so many conflicting opinions about Urea?,"Hi, I’m wondering why Urea is such a conflicting ingredient. Some people say it was the best thing ever for their dry and compromised skin and others say not to use it on a damaged skin barrier as it can damage it further.

Studies have shown that it can strengthen the barrier, and still some people say it is sensitizing.

I’m talking about 5% Urea as the higher concentrations have exfoliating properties.

What are your personal opinions about Urea? Did it help your skin? Or damage it?

I’m asking this because I’m interested in buying a moisturizer containing it!

Hey guys, I’m new to the whole skin care routine stuff, and I’ve got a good face wash and moisturiser I’ve been using for a few years that is reliable and works for my skin. I have just started incorporating sunscreen into my routine for the mornings (better late than never I guess lol). I don’t wear makeup, and I wanted something that I could double as a protective sunscreen and moisturiser in one. This one stood out to me due to the high SPF, and that it doubles as a moisturiser. My skin has always been quite up and down in regard to break outs in small sections, so I’m not sure if I am breaking out because of this sunscreen, or if I am breaking out because of external reasons. 

I have normal-oily skin (I think? I have read all the forums in this group and my skin isn’t overly oily, and it’s never really dry) the sunscreen doesn’t make me any more or less oily than normal and I love the Matt finish it leave on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling quite smooth. I am going to start incorporating a hydrating toner into my morning and night routine soon (just haven’t bought it yet). Was just hoping for a little guidance on how long I should be using it for before determining whether or not the sunscreen is the issue or not, and also whether I should incorporate the toner now, or wait until I work out if the sunscreen is causing me issues.

Round lab or Anua oil cleanser

Is a vitamin C-based or a hyaluronic acid-based mask better for me?

I currently use vitamin c serum as part of my morning skincare routine. I don’t use it everyday. But I feel like this is wrong based on information I’ve been reading online. I find it really overwhelming at how much different info there is on this lol so I’d honestly really appreciate a personal perspective from actual ppl instead, hence the purpose of this post. 

I currently have a “normal” (?) skin type. It’s not oily nor is it dry. I can get an oily t-zone (mostly in the summer) from time to time tho. My main skin concerns is wanting to get rid of some tiny blemishes (small spots) I have on parts of face and looking to make it more glowy. Since summer is coming up, I want to be able to feel more confident without wearing makeup since I really don’t like how makeup feels on my skin during really hot days. 

My current skincare routine (it’s really basic lol):

Morning: cleanser, vit c serum, moisturiser 

Night: makeup remover (only if I’ve worn any obvs), double cleanse, moisturiser.

I also do a face mask 1x a week.

1712443205.0,[Product Request] Non-lotion solutions for keratosis pilaris?,"Hi!! I’m new to this sub so hoping I’ve posted this right - if not im sorry lol

Can anyone recommend products that will clear up keratosis pilaris that arent like, some sort of lotion of cream?

Sorry this feels like TMI but I’m incapable of posting something without giving as much context as possible lmao. I have keratosis pilaris really bad on my butt, and kinda on my legs, and a little bit on my arms. I’ve also struggled my whole life with bacne, which cleared up in highschool after being on acutane, but seems to have come back (but far less intense), however now when I look at it, the ‘zits’ looks more like the bad pimple-looking keratin plugs and bumpiness I have from the keratosis pilaris on the rest of my body. It also doesnt respond to any classic acne treatments or cleaners (which is how I figured out the problem with the skin on my ass was keratosis pilaris, and not butt acne). 

Here’s the problem - all the OTC treatments I can find recommended are all variations of some sort of lotion, moisturizer or cream. Also exfoliators and scrubs, but those only clear up the dead/dry skin, not the keratosis pilaris itself. And I HATE lotion on my body. I think its a sensory thing - I hate the greasy, slippery feeling of lotion on my legs whatsoever, no matter how high quality the lotion or how minimally it’s applied. I also recognize that never using body lotion is probably the primary cause of the dry skin conditions that brought on the KP in the first place. 

Are there any products/treatment options for KP that aren’t lotions? Ideally things that can be purchased over the counter, I’d really prefer to not go to a dermatologist.

So I just found out that my holy grail sunscreen - Biore UV Watery Essence SPF50+ PA++++ Aqua Rich has xylitol in it. I was not aware before now because it just never occurred to me that skincare could have xylitol in it, and the ingredient lists on my tubes have all been in Japanese until now. 

So it's gotta go. I have two Labradors, and xylitol is EXTRAORDINARILY toxic to dogs.

I've been using it for a couple years, so logically I know that if there was enough in it to be a problem as applied to my face, we'd probably have already had ER vet trips because of it (much as we've trained them not to - they still occasionally try to lick faces when they're excited). But regardless, now that I know, I'm just not comfortable having it in the house for fear they manage to get into the tube somehow (or on the off chance that there IS enough to be a problem as applied, and we've just been VERY LUCKY about them not managing to get in a proper lick while I'm wearing it).

So... any suggestions? Ideally that is not going to cost an arm/leg, and that will have a similar texture/effect on the skin (so, easy absorption, non-greasy, light formula, not super intense sunscreen smell)? And of course, with no xylitol.

As of now I'm 3 months in on Accutane. But this isn't really about acne, I've noticed i have pretty visible mid cheek lines, i think some people call them festoons or malar bags. In addition to that I also have not as visible smile lines. Now I'm not really insecure about my smile lines but I am a bit insecure about those mid cheek lines. People tell me that I should sleep more even though I have a very good sleep schedule. They make me look tired and in addition to my smile lines they make me look like a 60 year old, especially from the side view. I don't do any cardio and I keep having this feeling that if i start doing some sort of cardio on a regular basis my face will look more ""lifted"" i guess. Also I just feel that my skin is very floppy when I'm running or something. I have this feeling that it bounces more than it should.

It cleared up ALL of pimples and I've had pimple free skin since then.

I might have skin with no pimples but I have SEVERE TEXTURE AND CLOGGED PORES. I have lots of visible pores in my t zone and you I can literally see the sebum like overflowing from the pores. I have LOTS of blackheads, sebacious filaments, those like white things on my chin, tons of clogged pores, and whiteheads. I tried 3 different types of BHA products to clear this and I tested each one for 1-2x a week for 2 months and it makes no difference at all! It won't go away!

I went to a dermatologist and she recommended 0.15% retinol prescription to me but my mom didn't let me use it because she says I'm too young. My dermatologist also gave me this other salicylic acid product to try and after using it for months I have no results!!

Everyone says to deal with clogged pores and texture by using bha, aha, and glycolic acid but IT DOESNT WORK ON ME SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO TO GET RID OF IT IF THATS ALL PEOPLE TELL ME TO DO?!! 😭 I'm seriously starting to lose hope because even a dermatologist couldn't make my skin better! And I know some people will say that like I should accept my skin because its normal and all but I have a severe case of clogged pores and it is such an insecurity. I have like no confidence or self esteem mainly because I hate how I look and I can't fix that by just accepting myself the way I am. I just can't do that. The only way I can be more confident is by fixing what I'm insecure about instead of just accepting it. So if someone could be please help me with my problem I would appreciate it so much.

1712422161.0,[routine help] Perfecting my differin routine,"Differin is the only thing that keeps my skin clear, but I’m having trouble building a routine around using it. I’d ideally like to use as few products as possible: cleanser, daytime moisturizer with spf or with a separate spf, nighttime cream, and differin.

I’ve listed below my current routine plus successes and issues with the products. I feel like I am so close to finding the right routine after so much trial and error but I’m just not quite there yet.

AM

Water or LRP hydrating cleanser - my skin is better when I only use cleanser once a day but the aveeno cream listed below doesn’t rinse off with just water. I’ve debated switching to aveeno cleanser because maybe it’d be less irritating used twice a day. I’m wary that too many LRP products is too much niacinamide for my skin and is causing some level of irritation, but it seems fine with it in small amounts.

LRP Double Repair Moisturizer - my skin looks absolutely glowing after I use this. My only issue is that I need spf and my skin gets irritated from the spf version. I debated using it at night, but it’s probably too light to use with differin.

insert spf or spf moisturizer. Pretty lost on this one, chemical tends to be irritating but mineral tends to be drying.

PM

LRP hydrating cleanser - explained above

Aveeno eczema therapy cream (using this because my skin is SO dry and it seems to do well but it’s too occlusive to use differin before it (irritated my skin) and differin wont penetrate it if used after. I debated using it only on the nights I don’t use differin or using it in the morning but it’s heavy and I don’t know if spf will work effectively with it.

Differin (every other day) - Works to keep my skin clear. No other actives are necessary.

Last notes on irritants: my skin breaks out from: shea butter, the ceteareth-20 ceteareth alcohol combination (rules out most cetaphil, cerave, and vanicream products) and larger amounts of squalene and niacinamide tend to make me bumpy.",1

I’m a 16 y/o (M) going through, Im assuming, just some hormonal acne, but it’s been pretty bad in the past couple months and I have pretty bad scarring on my cheeks. My acne and scarring is worse on my cheeks and I have a very oily forehead/nose/chin and pretty normal cheeks.

1712418798.0,[Misc] Cult Classics vs. Post-COVID/2021 Innovations,"We know that skincare science is slow, however, there has been an explosion in the skincare industry since Covid and the market has greatly expanded. There are some iconic products that weren't just a trend; they made a tangible difference to the industry:

* Skinceuticals' Vitamin C (2005) formula being evidence based and synergising
* Sk-II's first time essence (1980) for the use of ferments
* The Ordinary's niacinamide serum (2016?) for ingredient focus and affordable price range

Do you think any product released (or reformulated) **since 2021**, has matched these classics or even done better?

What products or brands do you feel have pushed the skincare market even further - either they are **firsts**, the **bests** or **unique** in some way:

* **Efficacy** or potency (TO's AHA potion comes to mind): do products today outperform the classics?
* Improved or **synergistic formulas, advanced delivery** etc. (Regimen Lab's Vitamin X serum for their multiple anti-oxidants? although Paula's Choice also has anti-oxidant serums, encapsulation technology etc)
* Ingredients with more **evidence** behind them, perhaps a proven ratio (perhaps new sunscreen filters could fit here) or simply **responsiveness to new research** which we see in Asian beauty with reformulations
* Accessibility & Inclusivity (braille on packaging)
* Sustainability & Ethics (Hada Labo offers refill packets)
* Price vs performance (explosion in Asian beauty has led to more knowledge regarding affordable options)

Other highlights I have noticed: brands releasing **SPF products with multiple shade ranges** and more awareness about catering to different skin colours. I am **not** talking about products that are micro-trends. Another example (yet to see if it's a microtrend or here to stay) is the Reedle shot serums, although I don't know how new the technology itself is, it is the first time I am seeing the marketing 'microneedling in a bottle' so it has at least made a splash in that sense, as well as being an effective product.

Do you think the reason the cult classics are so, is because the skincare industry then was subpar? Would they still be so famous if released in today's day and age?

**TLDR: post-2021 products that could go up against cult classics vs classics that are irreplaceable**",1
1712418526.0,[Sun care]I believe it's true that 80-90% of skin aging is caused by UV exposure based on my experience.,"For nearly a decade due to personal issues, I didn’t work or study,  spending most of my time indoors with the window shutters closed 24/7 to  avoid seeing my aunts and uncles. Thankfully, I resolved these issues  and began leading a healthy social life again. Upon re-entering society,  people often assumed I was 10 years younger than my actual age. Some  might argue that the lack of work or study-related stress contributed to  my youthful appearance. However, I was stressed about personal matters  and my future every day, indicating that stress wasn't the reason for my  youthful look. I concluded that avoiding UV exposure played a  significant role. Even after resuming my studies and work, I continued  to minimize UV exposure by avoiding activities like boating, hiking, and  camping, which I love, and stayed indoors during the day, venturing out  only at night. I applied sunscreen every three hours or even more  frequently, regardless of the season or if I was indoors, since windows  do not completely block UVA rays. Now, people often say I look more than  10 years younger than my actual age. A former classmate of mine, who is  Caucasian, works from home, and seldom goes outside, also appears much  younger than other acquaintances of the same age. Based on my  experience, I firmly believe that 80-90% of skin aging is indeed caused  by UV exposure. Therefore, using sunscreen is essential for UV  protection, but it may not be sufficient. Avoiding outdoor activities  during the day can further preserve youthful skin. Also, don't forget to  take vitamin D supplements if you're actively avoiding UV exposure.   ",1

1712417086.0,[Personal] I ruined my skin for life and I hate myself for it.,"I used to have perfect skin and never did anything for it. Never cared for it, never paid attention to it. Everywhere I went I would get compliments on my skin.

Everything changed last year when I was introduced to skincare. I knew myself that I was not ready for it and that's why I never touched it. I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, OCD, and all of these led to the many stupid decisions made later.

I started getting into skincare knowing nothing about it, and made many silly mistakes, tried products I didn't understand the use for. It started breaking down my skin barrier.

Eventually I broke out in pustules and my skin texture changed. I went to my local GP and they prescribed me steroids, without telling me what it was, and gave me a longer dosage than I should've used it for. After my course of steroids, I broke out into more pustules.

I went back to my GP  and they gave me a course of antifungals. I fell into bad depression during this period and my skin got worse and worse on the antifungals.

My skin eventually got badly infected and I went to a dermatologist 4 months later.

Now im left with many skin conditions (rosacea, seb derm, dermatographism) to deal with for the rest of my life, and a badly scarred face. Now I have to spend so much money and mental energy trying to help my skin, but my skin is not caring.

Every time i look in the mirror i just wanna rip my face off. I don't think I will be able to recover from this physically and mentally. I was not a very confident person to begin with already and this just greatly killed my confidence and quality of life.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just needed to rant :(

1712393170.0,[Personal] I ruined my clear skin and it destroys my life,"tw: eating disorder

this post highlights my poor life choices and ridiculous value system called out by skin condition. 

Hello, I’m 22f. I used to have mild acne ever since I hit puberty until I went to a derm at 20 y.o.. It was in June 2022. The skincare routine that I was prescribed back then was rather simple and effective, and I was happy with my skin quality after 3-4 weeks of doing it. I felt very confident showing up my face in public or when taking selfies. 

In October 2022 I moved to Japan for college. I stopped having access to the products that I’d been using in my home country. At that point I didn’t really know about skincare much, and I just blindly followed the recommendations of my derm, I was lucky enough it worked on me that soon, but it tricked me into belief that my skin would remain clear even though I’d switched to different products. Well, yeah it was a naive idea. 

In addition to new skincare, I had to get used to a completely different lifestyle and climate. In my home country I was living with my parents, and it’s not that I wasn’t cooking or doing any chores, it’s just that we shared them. So, after I moved out it all came down on me, and it’s been causing a lot of stress, as I have to take care of home chores all by myself and be successful at school simultaneously, which I have to admit I find extremely difficult (I know it’s a baby rant, but I have to be honest about it). As a result, I happened to have less time and energy to prepare food and I started eating out way too often. It’s important to mention that I have gastritis and acid reflux, and my stomach doesn’t mind to give me feedback any time I ate anything it didn’t like the slightest. While I was living at home it was easy to maintain a healthy diet, I had a lot of time and inspiration to cook for myself, but now I’m nothing like that and my diet is poor as shit.

[a little throwback in time] I picked up that healthy diet since June 2021 due to my stomach’s breakdown. Well, I picked it up and I lost weight quickly, I lost my period as well. However, I wasn’t worrying about my missing period at the beginning, as I was rather flattered by the fact of being ✨skinny✨
Long story short, I developed an eating disorder but I thought that the diet was good for me because of my stomach issues. It was actually good for my stomach, but I just wasn’t eating enough calories, thus, I kept loosing weight. I winded up being underweight for over a year, telling everyone that I’m healthy and feeling better this way! Oh, yes, you’re, yes, you’re!!! Thinking about food 90% of the time and having severe food anxiety!!! Man, that’s the definition of well-being!
At the end of the day, after I lost my capacity to cook for myself for the most part, I couldn’t help but started eating more unhealthy and high in calorie diet, which from this point of view is not even that bad. 

But the total waking-up from my ed happened after my skin started giving me hell. Japanese summer is very hot and humid which is nothing like back in my home country. Imagine what happens to the pore-clogging and acne prone skin in these conditions??? Right, it gives you worse pore clogging and acne. Over the course of 4 months (June - October) I developed acne as bad as I had never had. 
By then, I learned about skincare online, and I knew that the most effective thing to fight acne was retinol. I could get my hands on 💫differin gel💫, and so I did. 
And this is the part where it’s getting worse… I expected purging but I got irritated skin and face flushing after like a month of using differin. I applied it the  “sandwich method”, and I was building it up gradually, and I wore sunscreen daily, but my skin didn’t care it was getting more red and damaged. So I quit differin after 2 months.
My skin was so sensitive it flashed of hot air, drinks, food and ANY type of stress. Remember I live in Japan? By the way, my Japanese is far from great, it’s not that shitty, but my speed of speech and choice of words make me look retarded sometimes, so I’d feel embarrassed speaking it anyway. But when your face is covered in pimples and goes red, you feel even more embarrassed and the flare up goes wild.

So, I got pretty scared of this, and I went to ask Dr. Google about it. I learned that my symptoms and triggers were very similar to hot flushes women usually experience in their menopause. Well, call me stupid I absolutely deserved that, but this was the first time I had my eyes opened on why my missing period was bad for me. I started eating everything I could to restore my weight and hopefully get my period back. I went to doctors and I got all those tests. I was ENORMOUSLY lucky to get my period naturally in March after 1.5 years of amenorrhea (I had it in 2022 on pill, but stopped taking meds after I moved to Japan). 
I also went to a derm to learn I have developed rosacea. I was prescribed a new routine, and after one month of doing it I see good progress. However, it’s sooooo far away from the skin quality I used to have back in July 2022 - January 2023 (the moment it started to be getting worse).

I decided to write it all down, as I’ve been comparing my current self with the skinny and smooth-skinned former version of me. I can’t help but look at those old pictures pretty much every day, and it’s literally driving me insane. 
My confidence has died, and I don’t know if I ever be able to fully recover my skin. It’s unbelievable how much my appearance means to me. I’m so mentally drained.

After 2x cleansing (I stopped using cerave bc it made my face so dry and sensitive but one day in the shower I tried washing with an ivers bar soap and following with my second cleanse of the aveeno oat gentle cleanser, and my face felt clean and non irritated???? I ended up just sticking with doing this for the past couple of weeks!) 

At night:
Anua toner on damp skin 
Arazlo (3x a week)
Vani 
Sudo cream around nose (have rashes)
(1x a week during the night I use Paula’s)

Morning:
Warm water cleanse (no cleanser)
Vitamin c (though I don’t do this everyday because this vitamin c is really strong, maybe 3x)
Azaleic acid (everymorning)
Beauty of Josean sunscreen 

And that’s it! 


Psa: since swapping out my ceraphil moisturizer earlier this week to vanicream, I noticed all my closed comedies disappear which is crazy bc it’s marketed as non commodogenic and I was in shambles bc my moisturizer was the only consistent thing in my whole routine and I hadn’t changed brands for years! 

I also have niacinimide but I’m not sure if I should add it or where.. so if you guys have any suggestions lmk! ",1
1712391796.0,[Product Request] Combination girly in need of help: niacinamide? aha bha?,"Hello all. I - 20F - am having a bit of trouble with my skin recently.
First of all. I have no idea the type of skin I have: in my teens, so up until just a couple years ago, i would have said I had normal to dry skin around the nose area, didn't produce too much sebum and only had the occasional pimple every once in a while or during/right before my period. Lately, however, I've been noticing my skin gets a bit oily throught the day, specially if it's hot out, while during the winter it doesnt feel dry as much: the worst i get is right in the morning, I'm just a diff type of oily right when I wake up and go wash my face, i'm literally dewy (nose area especially). As of pimples I haven't noticed anything more than the occasional pimple when I'm stressed and/or on my period, so that's something at least.

Having said that, I would like to keep the oilyness at bay a bit more as it can get annoying at times, especially when i'm out all day and only get home and wash my face at 7pm. What can I do? I have heard niacinamide has sebum control properties but have never used it: i live in Italy and the only niacinamide I could find were The ordinarv's and the inkey list's, but have heard contrasting opinions about them, as some said their concentration (10%) was way too strong and got them to be more oily then before. In the past l've used the ordinary's AHA/BHA red peeling solution and loved it, i feel less oily the morning after using it and the days after that and my skin feels way softer; so I was thinking of going back to that as I haven't used it in a while, mainly because I honestly forget

Right now my routine consists of cerave SA smoothing cleanser (i know it says dry skin but it kinda worked for me + it contains Salicylic acid so i felt like it could exfoliate a bit daily; also the green classic one leaves me oily in 5 minutes) and a moisturizer that i love from an italian brand (the only moisturizer that doesnt' leave me oily and actually moisturizes my skin).

Any help will be highly, extremely appreciated, thanks!!!!",1

1712389182.0,[Routine Help] Stubborn flesh coloured bumps on neck and collarbones,"My neck, chest, upper arms and upper back are covered in these small flesh coloured bumps and I don't know how to get rid of them! I also have them on the lower half of my face, especially on my chin, but I have been using Epiduo for 2 months and it seems to be slowly helping, though it's hard to tell for sure. I have had them on my face for 10 years (minus a few years on accutane), but never on my neck or collarbones like this until recently. I haven't changed anything in my routine. I am 27F and I have very acne prone skin. I think they might be closed comedones because if I squeeze them, sometimes a white substance comes out. 

Face routine:

Morning: Rinse with water, Purito re-barrier cream or Cancer Council Matte SPF 50+ if I am going outside.

Evening: Wash with Femfresh sensitive wash (weird but I like it, has some lactic acid in it), Purito re-barrier cream, Epiduo (every second night), Ureaderm cream (10% Urea) on nights I don't use Epiduo

Body: I have tried salicylic acid washes and a sulfur soap in the shower for my neck and upper body to try help the bumps but it doesn't seem to have any effect, so I have just started using my normal soap again (Aveeno Skin Relief Body Wash). I am at a loss. I don't want to have to use any expensive creams to try fix this issue because the bumps cover such a large area of skin and I can't afford that! I am wondering if my skin has an issue with keratin/hyperkeratosis because I am seriously one bumpy lady lol.

Does anyone deal with these on their body? What can I do? TIA!

I tried everything. I tried different methods with my skin care products, but I just can’t find that specific one. I tried changing the temperature of my shower for my skin, tried changing how I washed my face, added a humidifier in my room, I am genuinely struggling 😭

1712365584.0,Advice pls! [anti-aging],Hi! I had terrible acne throughout my teens and early 20’s until I finally gave in and did Accutane in 2018. I just turned 30 and I’m dismayed to find that I’ve suddenly developed noticeable 11’s in addition to my acne scarring and hyperpigmentation. I’d like to finally feel good about my skin for the first time ever and I want to get treatment for both my acne scarring and my 11’s. What is the best place to start? I’m fine with Botox for the 11’s as long as it’s very minimal and natural. I’d like to find effective treatment for the acne scars and hyperpigmentation as well. I’m fine with more invasive procedures…whatever it takes! Do I start with a dermatologist? An aesthetician? What is the best course of action here? Thank you in advance!,1
1712364148.0,[Review] Inkey List 10% Azelaic Acid Serum,"You guys. This serum changed my liiiifffeee. 

This is the best my skin has looked in *years*. 

I've been using the same routine for about 6 months, with 2 exceptions. Firstly, I started using a different sunscreen in February because my HG was reformulated into trash. This sunscreen is nothing special, it doesn't have treatments. It's just a good sensitive skin sunblock. 

And then, around the same time, I started using the azelaic acid from Inkey List to help with my rosacea redness.

My skin's redness has disapated by 90%.  Not only that, the stubborn and constant acne I had been fighting the Fall cleared up within 10 days. My skin is the smoothest and softest it has been since I was a child. My skin inflammation? Gone. Dryness? Don't know her. 

I cut out all other actives (including retinols and bha/ahas) except vitamin C. It was meant to be temporary (I was only using these things occasionally anyway, except retinol 2x a week) to see how my skin would react to the azelaic acid alone and y'all... I'm not going back. 

It's been about 6 weeks and I am SHOOK. I am also getting tons of compliments on my skin all of sudden. Have no cons really other than it dries down a little dry but goes away as soon as I moisturize.  I highly recommend this product if you have mild to moderate cystic acne, skin inflammation, uneven skin texture, and persistent flushing and redness. 

Packaging is a basic black and white squeeze tube, does a great job not squeezing too much out, easy to use cream-like consistency. No detectable scent. ",1
1712363050.0,[Sun Care] Window in my new kitchen. Should I be concerned about the UV?,"Hi everyone.I recently moved to a house where there are a lot of windows. In my room, I have installed blackout curtains over the normal blinds, and a smaller, second window  covered with aluminium foil. But since i am living with my parents, the kitchen and the living room is a shared area so i can't just do things at my will like i did to my own room.

I go to get breakfast around 9am (when UV index can be anywhere between 2-4) every day and i have to be around the kitchen for a few minutes, and there is a big window there. I get anxious about the UVA rays, because according to my research, while an average window can block most UVB, it will let in more than 50% of UVA which is bad for your face. 

And the bathroom also has a small window and likewise i can't really put foil over it since it's shared. So every time i get up to wash my face i am exposed to some UV? 

It's going to take a lot to try and convince my parents to install UV sheets everywhere.. can i get some tips",1

1712361246.0,[Routine Help] So Many Actives to Choose From!,"Hi all!

I'm currently going through a bit of a skin care routine overhaul, and I'd appreciate some help. Currently, I'm rotating between using in the PM Adapalene one night, and Lactic acid 10% + Azelaic Acid 10% the other, with one day off a week. I also use the Caudalie Vinoperfect Serum in the AM, and have various products with low % niacinamide.

I'm first of all looking to switch out Adapalene with Tretinoin when I finish my current tube, but I'm also wondering if after my skin has gotten used to tret, whether it'd be worth switching up some of my other actives? I'm dealing with quite a few closed comedones, some uneven texture, and the occasional acne flair up, normally around my period. I deal with some red spots left by the acne, but the Vinoperfect that I introduced in the last few weeks seems to be helping that.

There's so many different actives out there, I'm not sure where to begin. Would it be worth switching out my AHA with BHA? What about Vitamin C? Is a copper peptide worth looking into? Should I use bakuchiol alongside a Vitamin A derivative? Should I try to decrease my Vitamin A derivative usage and up my exfoliant usage, or vice versa? Basically, any advice on actives would be very appreciated!

Hypochlorous acid is a very hot ingredient right now.  All the other HA mists on the market contain HA, water and nothing else.

The mister is lovely - very even and soothing.  Please buy it!  It’s sold on the pixi website and target.

Naeli Naturals - I never hear anything about this brand.  It’s an indie brand with a great product lineup.  I suffer from hyperpigmentation and their Kojic acid serum is the BEST I’ve ever used.  It contains Niacinimide and zinc and azelaic acid so it’s also anti acne and oil controlling.  It contains azelaic acid derivative APAD as well as Kojic acid, alpha arbutin, symwhite and other ingredients for discoloration.  It contains antioxidants glutathione and resveratrol.  It also contains licorice and strawberry extract.  Finally for hydration it has hyaluronic and aloe.  Nothing has ever worked this well for me.  The ingredients are in meaningful concentrations and most percentages are listed on the website.  It’s well priced and occasionally goes on sale for buy 2 get one free. Obsessed.  You should try it!!

Finally, inkey list ceramide serum (not moisturizer).  No one ever talks about this and I don’t know why.  THREE PERCENT ceramides, four different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid totaling 2.5%, loads of amino acids (which are an unsung skincare hero IMO), cholesterol and a number of other goodies.

First Aid currently holds the record for longest, though.

1712342622.0,[Personal] Lip Problem,"[Personal]

Hi guys! Okay so I have a history of dry lips since the pandemic and it has only gotten worse over the past years, but not like chronically. I’ve never been to the doctor for my lips bcos it wasn’t that serious so I didn’t put much thought into it. But recently, I joined this job, where the air is SUPER dry and stuffy, and i suspect that is the cause of my recent outbreak of dry lips (Like this time it’s worse than usual).

If u search up Cheilitis 94 Impetigo, I suspect that’s what Im currently suffering from, but the mild version. It’s red, and it’s flaky, specifically my upper lip, when’s Im in a dry environment for too long. 

Here is the catch. I’ve been putting QV lip balm (works wonders for me till now), but the cuts on my upper lip due to the dryness oozes out yellow liquid??? So everytime i put on my lip balm, which is waterproof, the liquid just gets trapped behind the lip balm, creating this disgusting bubble. 

So idk what to do. Should i go to the doctors? Should i stop using lip balm? Like it’s really affecting my mental health because I don’t feel good w this condition. Is it even curable????",1

After a week of using anti-fungal cream and not seeing a lot of improvements I thought about using only one drop of tea tree oil and it started to burn again, so after few minutes I removed it.

What I didn't know is that using tea tree oil undiluted can cause chemical burns and I noticed after a while that the skin where the rash is now looks burned, with thin skin that is shiny and plastic looking.

1712339097.0,[Acne] 30/f have had acne for 15 years and tried EVERYTHING and now have seriously low self-esteem - tips needed,"Hey all :) I hope you're all doing well.

I'm sorry to post something that's probably been posted a million times before, but I'm having a really bad mental health week with my skin, and I'm just looking for some last-ditch-attempt advice.

I've had acne since I was 15. I was on antibiotics for YEARS when I was younger. I've been on Accutane once, which cleared it for a year or so. I've been on spiro, which improved it, but I wasn't able to stay on this long-term for a host of reasons. The pill helped, but made me an emotional wreck, and I'd prefer to avoid the post-pill acne risk as I potentially want children in the next 3/4 years so would have to come off it anyway. I've tried all the main topicals.

I've done the natural thing too - had my hormones tested by a specialist, which showed low estrogen, and they recommended loads of stuff based on this which I do.... obsessively (it's kinda impacted my mental health, tbh). Namely, gluten-free/dairy-free diet, lots of protein but minimal simple carbs, mainly whole foods, some supplements, minimal caffeine, lots of veg etc.

So, my acne is definitely better than it was at one point but it's still consistent, mainly around my chin and jawline, all cycle long now, though worse during ovulation and before my period. I get cysts on my jaw and the ones on my chin start as little tiny whiteheads, stay like that for a while, and then randomly grow into a  full spot at some point.

I was wondering if anyone could take a look at my skincare routine and let me know if I'm perhaps doing something wrong, before I give in and go on Accutane again. I've done a ton of research and have tried to include things without commonly pore-clogging ingredients, but am I missing something?

My online dermatologist prescription company has recommended trying topical Clindamycin with the tret, which I'm tempted to accept, as it's really bad at the moment. Still, I'm worried what will happen once I come off as I know it can't be long-term.

AM:

* Cleanse with water only (only started this in the past week, after doing some research)
* Geek & Goregous Hydration Station all over
* Acnecide SPF30 all over

PM

* Oil cleanse with The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser
* Second cleanse with Simple Hydrating Gel Wash
* Tret 0.04% + 4% Azalaic Acid cream (Uncouth prescription) - Every other day, or I find it too drying
* Topical spiro 5% cream (this is a new addition - only been using two weeks - as recommended by Uncouth)
* Geek & Gorgeous Hydration Station
* Drop of The Ordinary Squalene Oil for a bit of extra hydration

I have stopped wearing makeup on my acne (three weeks ago) and now only wear concealer under my eyes, plus mascara/eyebrow makeup.

Around one week ago, I had been using Avene A-D Lipid Repleneshing Cream at night time instead of the G&G product. I was worried this could be what's clogging me up, so have removed it for now. I can definitely feel more dryness kicking in, but I thought the only way to figure out if fatty alcohols/silicones etc are contributing, would be to cut them out completely.

I don’t want to do too much because I do know too many products can make things worse, but I do want to try all these products to see what is best for me since the one product made such a huge difference. My dermatologist recently went through my whole previous routine and told me my toners and serums were unnecessary with my listed prescriptions (at the time, the same toners listed here and Glossier Supers (A Vitamin C serum, a Hyaluronic Acid serum, and a Niacinamide serum), but when I took those things out of my routine, my skin got dryer and duller and my acne got worse, so I’m interested in adding those ingredients back in.

Sorry for all the info, hoping someone who is passionate about skincare and ingredients can help me out!

EDIT:

I think I’m going to do the following based on feedback!

• Azelaic acid/Salicylic acid (Brightfacial) should not be used with Benzoyl Peroxide (Clindamycin), move one of these to PM

• Glycolic acid toner should not be used with Adapalene, replace with Micellar water for second cleanse

• Vitamin C also cancels out Benzoyl Peroxide, but should be used in AM. Benzoyl cancels out Adapalene. Consider moving Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide to PM and swap with Adapalene every other night

• If the above doesn’t work, eliminate Vitamin C, keep Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide in AM, move Brightfacial to PM

• Use Micellar water and rinse in AM before toner with HA

• Only use Babyfacial every 2-4 weeks to replace in-office chemical peels

First of all. I have no idea the type of skin I have: in my teens, so up until just a couple years ago, i would have said I had normal to dry skin around the nose area, didn't produce too much sebum and only had the occasional pimple every once in a while or during/right before my period. Lately, however, I've been noticing my skin gets a bit oily throught the day, specially if it's hot out, while during the winter it doesnt feel dry as much: the worst i get is right in the morning, I'm just a diff type of oily right when I wake up and go wash my face, i'm literally dewy (nose area especially). As of pimples I haven't noticed anything more than the occasional pimple when I'm stressed and/or on my period, so that's something at least.

Having said that, I would like to keep the oilyness at bay a bit more as it can get annoying at times, especially when i'm out all day and only get home and wash my face at 7pm. What can I do? I have heard niacinamide has sebum control properties but have never used it: i live in Italy and the only niacinamide I could find were The ordinarv's and the inkey list's, but have heard contrasting opinions about them, as some said their concentration (10%) was way too strong and got them to be more oily then before. In the past l've used the ordinary's AHA/BHA red peeling solution and loved it, i feel less oily the morning after using it and the days after that and my skin feels way softer; so I was thinking of going back to that as I haven't used it in a while, mainly because I honestly forget

Right now my routine consists of cerave SA smoothing cleanser (i know it says dry skin but it kinda worked for me + it contains Salicylic acid so i felt like it could exfoliate a bit daily; also the green classic one leaves me oily in 5 minutes) and a moisturizer that i love from an italian brand (the only moisturizer that doesnt' leave me oily and actually moisturizes my skin - i'm leaving the ingredients in the pic).

1712327643.0,10 Week Skin Update [B&A],"I am in my mid-20s with acne-prone combination skin. Back in October, I started experiencing a hormonal acne breakout. Here is how I went from 20+ active pimples at a time (cysts, whiteheads, CCs) to NO active breakouts for about a month now. 

Please see the 3rd picture for my current routine!! Cleanser, clindamycin, azelaic acid (for scarring), moisturizer, and SPF in the morning. Cleanser, tretinoin, moisturizer, cicaplast on my nose (for SFs), and aquaphor around my eyes and mouth at night. Clay mask or TO mask around once a week. 

Here are what I think were the biggest changes:
- removing B vitamins and niacinamide. I stopped taking a multivitamin that had both of these, and switched from LRP toleriane products that contain niacinamide. I use the toleriane cleanser a few times a week because I don’t want the bottle to go to waste, and it doesn’t seem to be breaking me out- I think it was the combination of many B vitamin/niacinamide products. 
- tretinoin! Game changer. I started with OTC adapalene gel and purged for about a month (not shown). Saw some improvement, but much much more once I started tret. 
- consistency. I make sure to wash my face twice a day, every day. I was doing this most of the time beforehand, but not all the time. It has to be every day!!

What I did NOT do:
- change my diet. I eat decently healthy but I do eat some fried food, dairy, processed sugar, etc. 
- change my pillowcase every day- don’t have time for all that laundry. 
 
I am very happy with my new skin!! This routine even stopped my monthly breakouts around my period! Happy to answer any questions :)",1

1712319724.0,[Sun Care] why is my face like 10x lighter than the rest of my body when it all used to be completely the same??," this isn't really that relevant  to this subreddit but this is the closest subreddit i could find to what i'm asking i guess there's no other subreddits closer

plus it says anything and everything about skin

anyway my skin colour is actually crazily uneven and idk why or how to fix it.

btw none of these hex things are 100% accurate they could be lighter or darker they're just SIMILAR i js can't find exact matches

my arms are similar to #ab7c46

my legs are similar to #c4975c

the lightest part of my face is #f1d1b9 and #dfb596 (this was colour dropped but in bright unnatural lighting so idk how accurate it is)

and the lightest parts of my body that just never see sunlight are #e6d9be (also colourdropped) OR the skin tone of my legs. my neck (also colourdropped) is #f0dabb

the thing is when i was younger my skin tone was completely even, like it was all the same. it was closest to the colour of my arms or legs and ever since i was like 12 every other part of my body just got really lighter. i'm 15 now and those parts of my body have just gotten even lighter.

mum is white from england and my dad is brown from chile (he is mestizo but has more indigenous ancestry). i'm australian so there's crazy sun but i never go out anyway. my mum is SLIGHTLY tanned bc we live in australia but her relatives (all of them live in england) are very pale, while my dad's relatives are either darker or paler than him but still similar to my old skin tone and his skin tone (his relatives in aus are darker than the ones in chile but there are still dark and light ones in either country). what happened to my skin colour and how do i get it back to how it used to be? 

idk what happened, i never even got a sunburn until i was like 12 when my skin started being lighter. now i get sunburned on my face and chest. i still never get sunburned on my arms, and i know that my arms/legs aren't just tanned bc i've been like that since when i was a baby. when i was a baby i was slightly lighter than when i was say 7 but not nearly as light as i am now. 

i'm not asking for products on how to make my skin darker or whatever but i kinda js wanna know why i'm lighter now it really confuses me. plus my dad is always saying i need to go back to my 'natural brown' which i want anyway but it feels like something i should b raising my eyebrow at.

btw i have sleep issues so for the past year i've been really unactive during the day and only at nighttime when there's zero sun. i don't go out into the sun like ever but when i do i get sunburned on my face n chest like is this js lack of sunlight or has some weird genetics thing happened to my skin idk??",1

1712302284.0,[Routine Help] Red marks under the eyes after starting skin care.,"Im 16. Started skin care recently (been 2 weeks or so) to treat low-mild acne and better my skin tone from hyperpigmentation (which I suspect I have - (even if i dont then skin care is win nevertheless). I have kept the routine fairly simple - a cleanser - (Cetaphil daily facial cleanser), a moisturizer - (Cerave PM moisturizer), a sunscreen - (from Isntree), retinol- (differen gel adapelene 0.1% and recently got a serum - (Versed stroke of brilliance). Have used the serum just once - planning to use it as little as possible (2-3 times a week)- (upon research Vitamin C or serum in general are not necessary for teens). Other than the serum - the other three products - I have used it regularly for the past 2 weeks or so. At first, I used excessive cleanser (not aware of the right amount -of course) - (two pumps - when 1 would be more reasonable). Then after being aware of the right amount of cleanser to be used - I immediately implemented it in the routine. The little incident caused redness and irritation around the under eyes area and beside the nose area- (The cheeks and area further from were fine). After implementing the right amount - no irritation occurred but some redness still remained. The most fascinating thing is when I apply the moisturizer it kind of burns around under eyes area. I lessened the amount of the moisturizer but how much ever the amount was there was the burning and caused the redness to increase. But after a couple of minutes, it will cool down and there will be no irritation or burning. But the redness around the more sensitive area (under eye and sometimes sides of the nose) still remained. Recently this worsened - there is a mark - not just redness but mark which is very dry (got a different texture than other part of the skin). The face produces white flakes ( because of the increased dyness - i guess). There is absolutely no problem with the sunscreen and the differen gel (it causes severe dryness but its normal). I am not certain of the cleanser and the moisturizer. I am quite suspicious of the moisturizer as it literally burns in the sensitive areas. The cleanser works fine with the skin with the right amount but cause redness - not severe ( idk if thats normal). I dont want to worsen the red mark under my eyes so havent applied any product expect for sunscreen (very much essential). The red mark seems to heal - i guess. Not as severe as it was two days ago. But there is increased dryness - (production of white flakes suggests so). Now I stuck in this situation where Im afraid of applying the moisturizer, but the skin really needs it. And I have the complete skin routine (with all the products) finally but I cant continue. From my best guess - I have dry and sensitive skin. What would suggest me to do here? Any experienced individual? Im confused on why the moisturizer cause would this as it contains all good ingredients (niacinamide, ceramides and others) and is from a well-established brand. I currently am not in the situation to switch moisturizer as I just barely persuaded my parents to buy. Probably after 2 months or so could get a new one. So any suggestions. How can I treat the ""mark"" faster? Shoud I continue with the routine? Or is it that the skin being introduced with products all of a sudden is giving me these reactions so I should gradually increase the amount and continue with the routine? Anything advice will help and would be greatly appreciated.",1
1712301808.0,[Personal] Really need help with my accutane dilemma.,"Before anyone asks, yes I've contacted my dermatologist and we will speak soon. But until then, I really need some advice.

Context: Male, 21, 67kg (147lbs) bodyweight, started 40mg daily in mid-December, was bumped down to 30mg last week.

The results were great even a month in, and have continued to get better. My face is essentially fully clear, my back acne is gone, and I get like one pimple every week, if that. I'm happy with that side of things.

Now for that bad part. I have never had a history of mental health issues. Never had depression, anxiety, any of that, and I am grateful for that. However, these past 2 months, I've been plagued with negative emotion, anxiety, unease, and intense sadness and emotional sensitivity like never before in my life.

It's been dark, and difficult, and a lot to deal with every single day. Only in recent days have I made the link that it could be the accutane amplifying this. There have been some life events which acted as triggers, but my emotional reaction has been really severe and prolonged, and not ""like me"" at all.

So here's the deal: I want to get off the drug, but I don't want my acne to come back - I really don't want a relapse after having the acne for so long and being on the drug for many months already. I don't want to repeat a whole course all over again.

Am I at risk of relapsing since I was on a low dose and haven't reached my cumulative dose yet?

Any advice or insight would be appreciated, these past 2 months of my life have easily been the most difficult ever.",1
1712301484.0,[Routine Help] how can I use sunscreen without having to change my life for it? ,"I had acne as a teenager and I still have discoloration and pigmentation, therefore I use makeup every single day and I don’t even leave the house without makeup. I usually just wear moisturizer under it and my morning routine takes me under one hour. I tried to use sunscreen, but it was such a time consuming „step“ that I really don’t understand how y‘all are able to wear it every day and incorporate it into your life. 

It starts with applying: If I apply too much, it will crust, so I apply it in small layers and wait for it to dry. Even if I just apply a single layer, I have to wait for approximately 30 minutes before putting on makeup. My next issue is that you should reapply your sunscreen every 2-3 hours, but how am I supposed to do that with makeup 😭 a spray sunscreen messed my makeup up and a stick isn’t working for me neither. Another problem is that my makeup looks more cakey and my facial hair is covered in sunscreen, and I can feel the sunscreen throughout the whole day. It also seems like any makeup (drugstore to highend) is have tried does not like the sunscreens I have tried, even though I make sure not to mix oils, water, silicones etc.

Now this routine has definitely helped me to reduce my acne. Ofcourse it’s not 100% reduced because I need to cut down sugar absolutely, but definitely effective, now I don’t have pimples as frequently as earlier.

The moisturiser is Fresh Black Tea anti-aging. However, it is VERY expensive and I want to try and narrow down what exactly my skin is responding to so well in this moisturiser so I can exore further.

This is my current routine:

AM- no cleanser,(sometimes hydrating essence sunscreen, Fresh moisturiser

PM- cleanse with cleanser, hydrating essence, Fresh moisturiser, rosehip oil

1x/week AHA/BHA mask

This is working for me, I saw a massive reduction in the tiny CCs on my nose that were untouched by everything except tretinoin 0.5%.

Ingredients my skin has previously liked: vitamin e, ceramides, squalene, sometimes niacinamide

1712289396.0,[Routine Help] Retinol when not using Tret? & Help with Uneven Skin Tone?,"Hiya! Just a quick question for you guys

Are you able to use a mild retinol on the days you’re not using tret?

I’m a beginner when it comes to tret, but I’ve been using the retinol serum by Olay for a year now on and off. So I started tret cream at 0.25 last week (Beauty Bliss) targeted for fine lines. My plan is to use tret once a week with buffing; I’m extra cautionary, because my sensitive skin doesn’t respond well to drying or harsh products. However, should I use my retinol that I use nightly on the nights I don’t use tret? Or should I just stick to tret once a week (at least for right now)?

Also, would anyone know how to get rid of uneven skin tone? I’m not exactly sure what to call it, but I have like a translucent uneven splotchy look to my face. It doesn’t look opaque and even, and it bothers me so much, but nothing I’ve done seems to fix it, but I wouldn’t say it’s hyperpigmentation either, because I don’t get acne there

*It’s possible I irritated my skin barrier, and I noticed this uneven skin tone after reintroducing the retinol after only using the tret once a week for a week so far.. Hmmm",1

Its so frustrating than nobody seems to understand how insecure this makes me feel. I really thought a derm would identify the problem. At least tell me something to reduce them or say that nothing can be done.

1712275428.0,[misc] Tips for puffy under-eyes?,"Hey everyone! Need some advice if anyone’s got any. 

Every morning when I wake up, my eyes are super puffy. My upper and lower lids are visibly swollen. After an hour or so, my upper lids go back to normal, so they’re not really my main concern here. My concern is that my lower eyelids stay puffy throughout the day and it makes me look super tired. I get told all the time that I look tired. Sometimes I feel like it ruins my face. Makeup can’t even cover the bags under my eyes. 

I’ve tried everything! Dozens of eye creams and serums, drinking more water, getting more sleep, cold and warm compress, eye drops, gua sha, etc. It only seems to make it worse. Surprisingly, the only time the puffiness goes away is when I’ve been awake for a very long period of time.

Just for context, I’m only 18, so it’s not anything related to aging. I’ve also seen an eye doctor and they couldn’t really find anything wrong. I have also had blood work done for my thyroid, and everything came back normal, so it’s not that.

I used the exfoliator once in a week. The mistake I had made was that both the facewash and the moisturizer are for dry or normal skin, whereas I had pretty oily skin. Throughout this routine, I had minor breakouts that were manageable and not too noticeable, but I kept going.

About two weeks ago, I accidentally used too much of the exfoliator (the pack instructs me to apply a thin layer on my skin) and applied it a bit liberally and perhaps even a bit harshly too. A couple of days later, I started having a major breakout on my forehead, cheeks and nose (all places where I usually get acne). I thought it was because of the facewash and the moisturizer and changed them to:

I have had used these two products for the first week and later discontinued using the moisturizer as I was advised against it by my friend (who is no expert, by the way) since I had oily skin and also because I had read that salicylic acid causes purging, and I wanted to get my acne under control as quickly as possible. I even stopped using sunscreen in fear of clogging up the pores and instead started using an umbrella.

Initially I thought it was skin purging because of the exfoliator, but can it be skin purging that was triggered by the high amount used at one instance if I had been using the product for at least a month?

For the last few days, I had started applying crushed camphor (mixed with some water) on the affected areas. It did help reduce acne on one of my cheeks, but the other areas haven't improved at all. This was something that treated my acne effectively when I was 16 after I started doing it after watching a random YouTube video.

My skin sometimes stings and burns, especially after facewash.

Now my acne hasn't particularly improved. Tell me what I should do, how long this will take to fix, and what I am doing wrong. Should I switch to acne-controlling products like facewashes with salicylic acid, over-the-counter ointments like AcneStar, etc.? Or should I keep it gentle and minimal, because I shouldn't damage my moisture barrier? Please, help me.

Hello everyone, I was taking accutane for a year, but with very low doses. I started with 10 mg, then raised to 20 after 4 months and took 30 for like 2 months. My dermatologist made me stop because my cholesterol was getting higher. And I had high liver enzymes in the beginning, so she was going slow.

Anyways, it went okay, I just had some dryness on lips and eyes. But, ever since I stopped, the itchiness came back. I am super itchy on my scalp and on my chest too sometimes. My skin tends to get red, especially my nose and cheeks. I do get some pimples here and there and my bacne is not fully gone. I am thinking of doing another round… maybe higher doses? I also have sebborheic dermatitis, I used to get irritated around my nose. So I am not sure if the itchy scalp is connected to that. I am also very oily off accutane. I can feel my fave get oily during the day and jt can even be disturbing, I wanna wash my face, it feels clogged. I have a problem using SPF too.

Any recommendations would be appreciated. Should I go back on accutane? Maybe take low doses over long periods? I miss my skin without excess oiliness and it not being itchy. I use a special shampoo but it doesn’t help much.",1

25f with combo skin who struggled with very persistent hormonal/cystic acne on my chin for years. I tried all the OTC products like BPO, AHA, BHA, adapalene, retinols but nothing helped. I had to reduce dairy and completely cut whey and animal based protein supplements because they turned my whole face into cysts. I turned to supplementing with vit D and spearmint tea a year ago which improved the acne a lot, but my skin destroyed itself all over again when I moved to a new city and these things no longer helped. 

But with being in a new (and bigger) I finally got to see a dermatologist and so happy I did, my skin hasn't felt this good in years. She prescribed me tretinoin and clindamycin and recommended I start using a benzoyl peroxide wash. 

I'm still at the point where my skin feels overall more textured and wrinkles/fine lines appear more visible than before I started, but that is slowly improving as well. I phased in the tretinoin to every day use over 6 weeks. I started the benzoyl peroxide cleanser at 10% and have since switched to 5%, as I found the higher concentration to be a little too drying/irritating and the 5% still does the job. 

The clindamycin helped a lot with the initial calming down until the tret could take effect. The BPO has kept my pores much cleaner than before.

Interestingly, I had tried BPO cleanser before, but it was the CeraVe brand which I didn't find did much for me at the time. The Differin brand cleanser, and perhaps it's in combination with the other products I'm using, works very nicely.",1

1712244222.0,[Acne] Tazarotene has changed my life,"Figured it was worth coming on here and posting this little story in case it is useful to others. I have (had?) persistent hormonal acne on my chin for my entire 20s. For the last 5 years I've taken 100mg spironolactone daily, which truly has been a life saver for preventing big cysts and whiteheads that I used to get. But even on spiro, my chin and jaw area has just been so congested and full of flesh colored clogged pores which I ultimately pick at and destroy my skin. No BHAs, AHAs, etc would even make the slightest dent in these and tretinoin left me in a continuous purging state for like 6+ months where progress was being made but it was slow and painful (mentally).

After seeing someone on this sub post their results with tazarotene, I did a lot of research and ultimately asked my derm for an Rx. I had a 2-week long battle with my insurance about which formulation they would cover, I ended up with the generic gel formulation in .05% (insurance said no to name brand Tazorac and even no to generic cream).

I am still in the process of building my tolerance, but after a little over a month using it, I could literally cry with relief. ALL of my CCs are gone. I still get new ones (probably from my makeup) but tazarotene demolishes them pretty quickly. For the first time in maybe 10 years I wake up in the morning and am not immediately in a panic to see what my skin looks like that day. I can finally start to focus on other skin improvements (like lightening all of my hyperpigmentation from skin picking) instead of just targeting my acne.

Since I learned about it from this sub and did a lot of targeted searches within the sub to hear about people's experience with tazarotene I wanted to add in my experience in case it helps anyone!",1

After accutane I was still getting breakouts about a week before my placebo pills. I talked to my gyno and we decided to switch me to Yaz. Pretty much immediately after starting Yaz I always have a least one cystic pimple on my face (anywhere from 2-3). I’m almost through my 2nd pack but I almost feel like my skin is getting worse. My dermatologist prescribed me Spiro 50mg then bumping up to 100mg after a week (I’ve been on this a little over a week now). I’d much rather deal with the pms breakouts rather than having 24/7 pimples. I’m soo discouraged and I don’t know if I should continue Yaz and see if pack 3 makes any difference but as the days go on and more pimples pop up I’m getting less hopeful. If I switch back to my old birth control after 2 months will my skin blow up even more? I’ve also been skipping my periods on Yaz (don’t know if that’s a good idea). ,1
1712242002.0,"[Product Request] Moisturizer recs (adapalene, cystic acne)","Hi! I'd love to hear about your HG moisturizer, particularly if you have cystic (jawline) acne and/or are currently using adapalene (or any other retinoid).

Current routine:

AM- Splash with water, Paulas Choice 25% vitamin c*, Elta UV Clear SPF 46, makeup (Milk concealer)

PM- ELF holy hydration makeup melting cleanser, LRP toleriane cleanser, adapalene 0.1% gel*, Elta PM Therapy moisturizer

I alternate between using vit c in the morning and differin at night - I don't do them on the same day. Also, if my skin feels particularly dry, I use gold bond healing hydration instead of the Elta moisturizer (I know it isn't for faces, but it's really thick and feels good).

I have mild PCOS which is definitely a contributor to the cystic acne. Hormonal birth control isn't an option. Spiro has helped some in the past, but isn't currently an option because I'm breastfeeding and donating excess to the NICU (and Spiro isn't allowed for donation. Totally fine to be on it if you're just feeding your own kid though!)

Things I've tried and not really liked:

* Neutrogena water-gel and gel-cream; a derm recommended these and they felt *really* nice but I think the water-gel gave me CC and the gel-cream made the cystic acne worse
* LRP double repair moisturizer; used for a month, no change to cystic acne
* First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream; used for less than a month, almost immediately experienced an increase in cystic acne, didn't enjoy the feel
* Cetaphil, CeraVe- used these like a decade ago, but after they reformulated I started getting worse cystic acne. Haven't tried them in probably 7 or 8 years.
* Vanicream- used for a couple of months, no change really, didn't love the feel

Honestly, the Elta MD sunscreen has been one of my most consistently favorite products. I went through a phase where I used it as my moisturizer night and day and I do think there was a decrease in cystic acne but my skin was otherwise pretty dry after a while. I tried to introduce niacinamide on its own, thinking that had something to do with it, and it just made me super flushed and I don't think it didn't much.

I'd love something that feels light and absorbs like the Neutrogena water-gel, but at this point I'll take anything that doesn't exacerbate cystic acne. I do think one of the problems there is excess unexfoliated skin (and buried fine hairs) so if you have other Actives suggestions to help with that, I'm all ears.",1

Hi, 20M, currently using Adap 0.1%/niacinimide 4%/ clindamycin 1% lotion and after steadily increasing the application to every night my acne that I’ve battled so hard for so long is finally clearing.

Is it best to reduce the application of adapelene once it has cleared your skin? Maybe 2-3 times a week so you can ramp up the usage if your skin gets worse again. Not sure, ultimately just want to prevent this awesome stuff from a plateau!

1712225345.0,[Routine help] Skin now oily and pores are larger after caring about skincare,"
Hi could someone share some insight as to what’s going on. Before I used to do skincare my skin was normal, with *slight* oil on my forehead and nose and now that I’ve started taking care of it going through products and different things, the pores on my cheeks are now larger with size and my skin is really oily when I wake up and throughout the day. I do notice that if I don’t skincare for a while, my skin is back to the normal level of oil (barely any) but I will get pimples and stuff from not washing my face.

** Dates are at the top of each photo! …  I know it’s not all the same exact lighting, but I tried my best choosing all pictures in natural sun light that highlighted all the texture under the makeup! **

Tried Tretinoin in 2022 but only stuck with it for about 6 months & stopped…. I started using Tazarotene .1% on July 15, 2023. I stuck with it for a bit, but then started feeling like the cream version was still clogging my pores (just like the Tret cream was prior) & causing stubborn closed comedones. Soon after (I forget exact date), I switched to Tazarotene .05% gel. I started seeing much better results after switching to the gel version. I always monitored my progress by taking pictures when I had makeup on since that’s when my skin texture was MOST obvious to me. I hated wearing makeup for so long until now. I finally feel good when I get ready & can see the major improvement in texture under my makeup. I’m so happy & excited to see even more progress as more time passes! I’m starting to feel a lot more confident when I’m getting ready for the day <3

I'm 35 F and living in Europe. I've never had an elaborate routine and mostly used daycreme and sometimes nightcreme. In spring/summer I use sunscreen as well. I also don't use a lot of make-up, just soms mascara and eyebrow pencil.    
As I'm become a bit older, I see more lines and wrinkles appearing, so I want to invest (both time and products) in my skin care. I've already read a lot of information on this site (so thanks!), I'm am hoping for some on advice on my current routine and possibly some products to add.   
Skin: rather dry + hyperpigmentation in the form of freckles (have had them my entire life and love them!). Not really prone to acne (I am very lucky that way :)), but a bit sensitive.  I also have dark circles under my eyes (since I was a kid). 

**Current Routine:** 

AM:   
Wash with water  
Eye cream: Clinique All about Eyes  
Day moisterizer: Eucerin Hyaluron-Filler +3x Effect + SPF 30  


PM:   
Cleanser: Garnier Micellar water Pink cap -> I think this might be to harsh for me because my skin is feeling a bit tight/dry after.   
Eye cream: Clinique All about Eyes  
Night Moisterizer: Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask  


**What I am looking for:**   
\- overall tips on my routine?   
\- Tips on cleansers that are very soft for the skin?   
\- Tips for the dark circles under my eyes: I have had them since I was a kid, so I don't think there is a magical solution here?   
\- Is there something I can add for prevention of more/thicker wrinkles? I was thinking of maybe adding a serum with Hyaluronic acid like La Roche-Posay Hyalu B5 Anti-Aging Serum?   
\- I don't want to include Retinol as I might try to get pregnant again in 6 months.

i have very dry skin. but it’s also extremely sensitive. my skin reacts badly to hyaluronic acid, the clay mask you see pictured and, to my surprise the la roche posay moisturizer. by badly i mean burning, tingling, redness, etc. i did some research and discovered that hyalauronic acid is not supposed to burn and glycerin can be a good substitute, but i have not tried it yet. now, how is a clay mask supposed to feel on the skin? i haven’t used it in a while for obvious reasons, but when i did, i used it about once or twice a week. so what other masks are out there and what are some good and healthy skin moisturizers for sensitive skin you all would suggest? 

i do use the Yuka app to check the ingredient list on products so i would also like to know how you all feel about the app and what you gain from it and what you leave behind. 

lastly, if you see anything on my face you would like to provide advice for, please feel free.

i’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, apologies if not. i am looking for recommendations for my mom’s skincare regimen so i can make her a little skincare basket for mother’s day next month! i thought since the sephora sale is coming up, i should take advantage and buy her some skincare from there if i need to. 

she’s been asking me to create her a skincare routine for a while now, but i thought id just go ahead and buy her everything she needs as a gift. she’s 50 this year, and she has beautiful skin. she has hardly any wrinkles on her face, only has some crows feet near her eyes. she has pretty dry skin, and she gets especially dry/flaky on her nose area. she doesn’t have sensitive skin, and never breaks out or anything. 

her current routine is:
-st ives scrub as face wash (i’ve told her not to use this but she doesn’t listen lol)
-origins ginzing ultra hydrating cream (she only has this because i initially bought it & it was too intense for my skin. she loves it though)

i’m thinking of getting her a new cleanser, SPF, some serums/toners, and maybe a retinol? i am open to buying from anywhere, not just sephora. i also don’t really have a specific budget & id love to get her some nice skincare & maybe body care as well! body lotion, wash, etc.

i don’t know much about skincare, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

1712207919.0,Pityrosporum folliculitis trigger? [acne],"Hello!

So, long story short, I woke up yesterday with my normal, clear skin. Took a shower and went about my day only to come home from errands and find a bumpy, textured forehead. 

I went to the derm today because it’s very odd for the skin on my forehead to get like that. It’s usually completely smooth. I thought maybe I had contact dermatitis or something because it’s also kind of textured along with the bumps(they’re only in the middle of my forehead and the right side and right temple, none of the left side). She diagnosed me with pityrosporum folliculitis pretty quickly, said it’s kind of stubborn to get rid of but since I caught it earlier on it should clear up faster than usual. Got prescribed all the usual stuff for it.

Anyways, I’m trying to figure out what the hell caused it. I haven’t chnaged my skincare at all. I do have bangs and blew dry my hair after I showered yesterday(round brushed my bangs) and specifically had to go over an unruly piece on the right side, so I’m wondering if an excess of hair product or maybe just a dirty brush are to blame for it(I’m not good at cleaning my hair brush, gross I know). But I just found it very odd for my skin to be acting up like this when it is normally clear albeit the random hormonal zit on my chin. 

*edit would also like to add that at the end of Feb, I had a miscarriage and a bad UTI that wouldn’t go away. Had to take a few rounds of antibiotics. So maybe either the hormones or the use of antibiotics caused the trigger of fungal acne on my forehead? I just got my period back a few days ago so maybe that? I would think because I stopped taking the antibiotics about a month ago that it would’ve triggered it then. I’m not sure lol. ",1

I'm sure I have fungal acne because she did a fungal culture test and it came back positive.

How can I get rid of these, and has anyone else experienced wrinkles this deep as young as i am?

1712187943.0,Is it too late to start a proper skincare routine at 20? [Personal],"
Hello, first time poster here. 

I have acne-prone combination skin, oily on my front cheeks, chin and nose; and rest of my face is just dry- it feels as dry as a sandpaper really. I used too many commercial products (like nivea and neutrogena) for acne: cleansers and moisturizers- and actual ointments prescribed by dermatologists. Also some natural oils as well- only to have worse effects. I never had good results and stopped the treatment for acne due to terrible irritation and scars. I don't know much about skincare and that was the best I could do. 

I started using Yves Rocher products 3 weeks ago- only a cleanser with anti blemish feature and a moisturizer with sebum controller properties, and a regular sunscreen. Overnight I apply a thin layer of vaseline. The results are incomparable with all the products and medications I used. My acne visibly lessened, pores look cleaner even smaller, and my skin is glowing not because of excessive oil but in healthy way. 

I was wondering, am I too late? My friends have been Following routines for years and I just started having a proper one just now. I am actually worried about having wrinkles at early ages.

1712178828.0,Tips and Advices for Helping Manage Seborrheic dermatitis [Product Question] [Routine Help] [Personal],"Hello everyone! I’m a new member in this community and I’ve always been just a silent reader here on Reddit so please bear with me. I’ve decided to post on here to ask for help as someone whose partner has just been newly diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis. 

Around June last year, my boyfriend went through a very stressful time with his studies. This is when his skin flare ups began, and he started noticing a certain type of inflammation all over his face. He described it to me as very itchy, warm, and very dry. Sometimes, it would go away for a few weeks but then it would also come back randomly. Basically, it is recurring and would often come during the most inconvenient times. We’ve also noticed a pattern wherein the flare ups would be worst when he is experiencing stress from exams, traveling, or sometimes, even the weather. Based on the information I’ve gathered from the articles I’ve read online and the community posts I’ve browsed on here, those are just some of the typical symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. 

I’ve been through a similar situation with my skin back in high school as I’ve struggled with fungal acne for over 4 years, which is why I know how difficult it must be for my boyfriend to be going through the same situation. As much as I want to help, there’s only so much I can do from reading and researching. I want to be able to actually become a good support system for him especially now that his skin condition has been taking a serious toll on his mental health. 

He’s gone to 3 different aesthetic/dermatologic clinics already, and unfortunately has had little to no luck in improving his skin condition. I could say that I’m a bit familiar with skincare and skin products thanks to the research I did back when I has acne, and personally, I don’t think the regimens prescribed to him before were helping him. One could even say that his skin got triggered even worse.

However, he visited a new clinic and a different dermatologist recently. I’ll update this post later on and list down the products prescribed to him and maybe you guys could give a heads up about the stuff to watch out from those products. It would be a huge help.

It would also be greatly appreciated if maybe you are experiencing or have experienced the same situation, could give tips, advice, reminders (what to watch out for)and even product/regimen recommendations for my boyfriend. For context, we are from the Philippines where it is always humid. Again, any help is welcome!

1712177307.0,[acne] tips for dealing with breakout from boyfriends beard?,"Hello everyone! I’ve been struggling with breakouts every time I’m with my boyfriend. It started as a small breakout but now it seems to keep spreading because a new breakout happens before the old one calms down. I’ve determined the breakout is likely caused by his facial hair rubbing against the side of my face when we kiss (especially when we are being intimate). The right side of my face is horrific while the left is completely clear. It’s very frustrating for me because I just finished a round of accutane in September. 

Everyone keeps telling me it’s not that bad, which frustrates me more because the majority of people haven’t dealt with acne to the same degree many of us have. It can be pretty scary to go on accutane and then start getting breakouts again (even if caused by your boyfriend’s beard LOL). 

Since Tuesday I’ve used Panoxyl in the morning and night (just on the affected area) AND I’ve also used a BP spot treatment. During the day (as post accutane treatment) my dermatologist has me using finacea :)

1712177197.0,Unusual TCA Peel Experience - Need Advice and Insight! [Personal],"Today I had a 20% TCA peel at a reputable clinic in my country, and something happened that I found quite alarming, prompting me to seek audience thoughts and advice.  
  
The procedure was performed by a practitioner who, I later discovered, is a general nurse practitioner. This was my first time getting a TCA peel, and based on what I’d read and heard, I was expecting a relatively quick application process. However, I was instructed to leave the peel on my face for 8 hours before washing it off with a gentle cleanser provided by the clinic. Additionally, I was given a cream to apply for the next two days post-procedure.  
  
From the research I've done, it seems that leaving a 20% TCA peel on for such an extended period is highly unusual and potentially risky, posing a significant risk of severe skin damage, such as chemical burns or scarring.  
  
I’m feeling a mix of emotions right now—confused, concerned, and frankly, a bit scared. I’m reaching out for a few reasons:  
  
Has anyone here experienced or heard of leaving a TCA peel on for 8 hours?  
  
What should I watch out for in terms of adverse reactions? If you have advice on signs of complications that require immediate medical attention, please share.  
  
Also, any advice on how to proceed with the clinic or practitioner? I’m contemplating the best course of action, including whether to address this directly with the clinic or seek external advice or reporting.  
  
Currently it's been 6 hours after my TCA procedure. There was initial moderate burning when it was applied but it subsided very quickly. After I left the clinic, there was no pain or discomfort. The skin looks like it had a moderate sunburn. It still is a little red. There are no alarming signs yet but I'm concerned that they might appear following the next days.  
  
So..should I be worried? What would be your recommendations?

1712167233.0,[Routine Help] New to 'proper' skincare? Advice?,"Hi!

As the title says, I (27f, UK) am new to proper skincare, that is, beyond moisturiser (usually with spf) and face masks. Part of the reasoning is that I have very sensitive skin, I very often have redness and spots from irritation for reasons that I'm sure change day to day.

I have combination skin I believe, but lately has been more on the dry side (with irritation, especially on cheeks/forehead, I've been trying new probiotics that made it worse but the 'extra' irritation has subsided a fair bit now). One of my main complaints is my skin looks dull, dark circles (always have been an issue) and while not 'saggy', could definitely have more of a clear/plump/glowy appearance. It's definitely a knock to my confidence and something I'm trying to sort.

I only really have a daytime routine with new products (marked *) started a few days ago but don't seem to be irritating my skin surprisingly.

• Face wash: Simple refreshing facewash or Simple exfoliating wash 

• Serum: Beauty of Joseon revive serum*

• Moisturiser: Simple (rotated through their brand, but it's one of the few that my skin can take)

• Sunscreen: BOJ relief sun*

Sometimes: Elf holy hydration sleeping mask, sheet masks (usually Garnier, with their moisture bomb on currently), Grüum retinol and vit c eye roller, Body Shop green tea mask, Witch Hazel 'calming' masks

Other than that I try and stay hydrated through water and copius amounts of green tea. 

Brands such as Nivea, La Roche-Posay, Cerave historically have irritated my skin.

So I really need any help I can get! I am also on a low wage so really can't spend too much on skin care, this is the most I've splurged ever (I even ordered the Tower 28 sos spray but that's still stuck in the US but excited to try!)

1712166469.0,[Sun Care] Mineral sunscreen with very inocous - with respect to smell - inactive ingredients?,"I go out for bicycle rides on the regular, typically 2-1/2 hours for a weekend ride. I'm not completely covered by clothing, so sunscreen comes into play.

My challenge is that I have loved ones who are very, very sensitive to smells. Even if I scrub pretty thoroughly with washcloth and soap in my post-ride shower, the sunscreens I have tried so far still leave enough residual smell to cause a problem (e.g., can't sit down with my family for a meal without ruining it for them).

Our working hypothesis at the moment is that it's something in the inactive ingredients that is the culprit, as it has happened even with a mineral-based sunscreen. So, I'm looking for something that has inactive ingredients that might be less olfactorily objectionable to said loved ones. I don't think that I could beat this problem by using a product that deliberately adds fragrance, so I'm looking for something that is fundamentally more inocuous than what seems to be commonly used for inactive ingredients.

One candidate might be Badger Adventure Mineral cream. That uses sunflower seed oil, beeswax, and tocopherol. The downside is the price: USD 15-17 for a 2.9 fl. ox. tube, depending on whether it's SPF 30 or SPF 50.

I did find a recommendation on Reddit for one sold by Whole Foods under their 365 brand. It's their [30 SPF ""Sport Lotion Mineral Sunscreen""](https://www.amazon.com/365-Everyday-Value-Mineral-Lotion/dp/B07DFNW4DC), and it shows the same inactive ingredients as Badger, plus a couple of other plant oils. The other difference is that, in contrast to Badger, they do not claim that the zinc oxide is ""nano"" in nature. USD 9.99 for 6 fl. oz. makes this about 1/3 the price of Badger.

The only thing that I find concerning about the Whole Foods 365 product is that there are a significant number of reviews claiming that it simply did not work as a sunscreen - as in, the reviews claim that people used it, and got sunburned. I can disregard a bad review from what appears to be the occasional crank, nitwit, or sincerely confused person, but there were enough of these that seemed genuine to give me pause.

So, OK, down to specific questions:

* **Does anyone have personal experience with the Whole Foods 365 product?**
* **Any personal recommendations (or non-recommendations) for other sunscreens that use plant oils and beeswax as the inactive ingredients? Other similarly inocuous inactive ingredients?**

I am already aware of the ""ride in the dark"" option!",1

Hey! 
So my skin has always been weird in that whenever I do nothing to it it looks great (and I mean nothing)- no breakouts or spots, maybe some bumps under my eyes that I think are called millia? But the second I try a skincare routine, even if it’s nothing but wetting my face and then putting moisturiser on, it all goes to hell. When that happens I stop using anything until it goes back to normal…and then I tend to try again cause I don’t want the products to go to waste (dumb I know)

Sometime last year I tried again and used an expired (I didn’t notice at the time) vitamin C serum that I think caused this nasty reaction on my forehead. I got these little bumps/rash that itches like crazy and then got crusty/scabby and itched more. In the end I cut some bangs so I wouldn’t see it and stop picking at it. It cleared up to the point that it’s not itchy anymore, BUT it is VERY dry and flaky and will react negatively to anything other than Vaseline. I also have dry patches like that on an eye lid? 

Me being a dumbass, did a face mask (made of rice idk it was sticky) last night and now it’s back to being red. Not itching or dry and flaky, just red and irritated/raised, and I figured I could ask and see if anyone knows wtf it is or how to get rid of it. I do plan to see a dermatologist at some point but it just hasn’t been possible yet.

1712793712.0,How are you supposed to apply sunscreen under your face makeup?,"I usually just wear sunscreen on it's own or my Ilia face tint (which is SPF 40) when I need coverage.  However, I recently purchased the Fenti skin tint and I LOVE IT.  The only issue is that there is no SPF in it...

I use the cerave facial moisturizer with SPF 30 sunscreen in it but I don't think that it would be good under makeup.  It always leaves me a slight white cast too.  So I am now in the market for a good sunscreen, higher then SPF 30 that can go under your facial makeup.  Give me your best recommendations please!!



Oh yeah, and I also don't know how to wear sunscreen under makeup in general (bc I'm used to just wearing a skin-tint with SPF already in it).  

Am I able to wear primer on top of my sunscreen or will that break it down?  I'm going on vacation to Europe this summer so am looking for something that is long-lasting (hence why I was wondering about the primer situation) and good quality.  TIA!!",0

1712788480.0,How do you guys feel about the new NARS blush?,"Do you like the new formula vs the old?

Overall I would say that it definitely seems to glide on smoother and seems more pigmented. I definitely appreciate the no talc too.

I wore the shades Orgasm and Orgasm X in the old formula, that I still have.

I’m not sure if the new shades are an EXACT match to the old. At first glance, they seem slightly peachier, but I think they change color depending on how the light catches, so it might just be my imagination. Overall, this isn’t a deal breaker, because it’s pretty hard to tell. 

Sorry if these pics aren’t great. I tried to take the best swatches in natural light I could (and please ignore my terrible dry hands lol)

The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pic is Orgasm X in the new formula on top and the old formula on the bottom. 4th and 5th pics are also Orgasm X (new on the left, old on the right) in different lighting. It seems that even though the new one looks peachier, when the light changes, it looks pinker. 

The 6th and 7th pics are Orgasm in the new formula on top and the old formula on the bottom. As you can see, the new one looks pinker in one light and peachier in the other, and vise versa.

I hope this was helpful.

Overall, I think I do like the new formula more, just because it seems like a smoother application and no talc. I’ll also do a hand wash test when I get home, and see which one stays on better - new or old formula, and update the post.

So do you guys like the new formula and which one do you prefer?",0

Hello! I am here mostly to ask anybody who’s used hairspray as a setting spray if it’s worked out for you and how bad is it really for your skin? Also if there’s any gentler hairsprays that would work or if there’s a makeup setting spray you’ve tried that actually works. I have combination skin I have oily skin with dry patches around my mouth nose and eyes but a very oily t zone and cheek. I don’t like powders as they just cling to the texture of my skin and I’ve never enjoyed how they wear either but I’d be open to suggestions if anybody had a recommendation. I work in a deli bakery and I am frequently sweating from cleaning fryers and washing ovens and baking stuff. I work 8hours and I love wearing makeup but my foundation and concealer and blush wear really bad no matter what i seem to do. Below I will include products i’ve tried and the makeup I wear daily.

Daily Base: 
- Elf camo concealer all over or nyx can’t stop won’t stop concealer
-Nyx bare with me priming spray
-elf putty blush and I set it with a milani blush
that’s all, i don’t use any other base products 

Sprays I’ve tried: 
- UD all nighter
-Milani make it last
-Nyx matte setting spray
-Nyx Bare with me setting spray (it’s what I use to prime now)
-Elf setting spray (black one)
-Hard candy setting spray (the pink and green one)
-One size setting spray
-Morphe Setting Mist
-Revolution Setting spray (it’s the sport one)
-Ben Nyx Final seal (this was years ago but i may try again) 
-Dollar store setting spray
-Pixi setting spray

Powders I’ve used:
-Maybelline fit me the loose and pressed
-Airspun loose
-Etude house zero sebum
-Innisfree no sebum
-The Saem Perfect Pore pink
-cornstarch
-elf hd powder
-wet n wild (the clear one it’s like 3$)
-l’oréal powder foundation
-Laura Mercier loose powder 
-dollar store powder (it’s the clear bpure)

Hi 👋 
I usually wear the shades Stromboli in the NARS radiant long wear foundation and shade 290 in Fenty but recently I have got Malasma due to me being pregnant with my son and my skin tone has become slightly darker.
So much so that these shades are now too light for my skin tone.

This is me with no make up on in natural lighting by my window.
The last two photos are swatches in the shade Stromboli and then 290 in the Fenty foundation.

https://imgur.com/a/RNQeRi7

I do colour correct but then this usually changes the colour of the foundation slightly.
I don’t know if I should buy a darker foundation or if there’s anything I can do to make these foundations work.

Does anyone else suffer with Malasma or hyperpigmentation?
If so what do you do to make your foundation shades work?

This was me wearing both foundation shades before I got Malasma.
The first photo I’m wearing the shade Stromboli and the second I’m wearing the shade 290 in the Fenty foundation.

1712756299.0,Charlotte Tilbury Setting Srpay vs. Maybelline Setting Spray,"Hey! I know this may sound super strange to some of you, but yeah, basically what the title says

I purchased the classic Maybelline Lasting Fix about 10 months ago and it worked pretty well for my skin. I applied it between layers of foundation and bronzer/blush for nights out and it served its purpose.

Now, after a while I got really into make up and decided to invest in the CT Setting Spray for a more luxurious experience, assuming it would last even longer and work better. Turns out it didn't. My make up doesn't last as long at all.

I've tried applying it in different ways: Before primer and foundation, after layers and for the final touch. Or Just at the end. Or just at the beginning. Or in between steps. It doesn't matter, my make up just fades away. Since it was pretty expensive and the reviews are great, I was wondering if maybe I'm doing something wrong. Should I try something different? I have combination skin with an oily T zone but it's pretty manageable. For skin care prep, I wash my face wirth a salicilic acid cleanser, and always apply a niacinamide and a hyaluronic acid serum and finish with the Neutrogena watergel hydrating cream.

My make up routine for going out (complexion wise) usually consists of the L'Or primer by Guerlain, the Les Beiges Chanel Foundation, the make up by mario contour stick, the rare beauty blush and some huda beauty cherry blossom loose powder

For now, I'm sticking with my Maybelline Setting Srpay. But am I doing something wrong? Has anyone else had a bad experience with the CT Setting Spray?",0

1712753740.0,What's the best foundation without sunflower products in the ingredients?,"Hi there! I have super sensitive, combination, acne prone skin (my skin was relatively clear but still sensitive, combination pre IUD placement, if that matters). I'm allergic to sunflower, and pretty much everything with sunflower listed in the ingredients makes me super itchy. For this reason, I tend to avoid foundation altogether. Rifling through ingredients lists is already tedious for lotions, shampoos, conditioners, body washes , etc., especially since sunflower is a very common cosmetics ingredient.

The only reason I want foundation currently is because I have an event coming up that will have a ton of photos. Because my IUD has trashed my skin, I'd really like to not feel that way when the camera comes out.

Does anyone have any suggestions on sunflower-free foundations? I really don't care about cost/budget/brand. I'm also willing to buy two shades and mix to get the right match, if necessary, but a wide range of shades is a plus.",0

1712722679.0,13 year old makeup. Safe to wear? ,"Okay so I have a BECCA highlighter & a Too Faced blush.

When I was around 14, I got really bad acne. I was miserable. I begged my mom for makeup to cover them. At first she didn’t allow it but then she gave in. For my 14th birthday, her and I went to Sephora and she bought me $300 worth of makeup. Those two things happen to be in the makeup stash she bought me. 

I am way older now. 

The BECCA highlighter and the too faced blush both are cracked into pieces. I plan to use some alcohol and fix it but my thing is.. is it safe to wear? 

I have not worn them in a long time. Just kept them with me for sentimental value because they were happen to be couple of my first makeup items gifted by my mom. I adore them.

1712714233.0,Foundation lifting when i apply cream contour. ,"So I feel like I have tried absolutely everything! And when I apply my contour it lifts exactly where I’m trying to tap it on. I’ll explain my routine in steps along with the application method. I have combination skin that leans more on the dry side
Skin prep: toner(cereve hydrating toner), essence( cos rx peptide), serum (ordinary niacinimide sp?), sunscreen (elf mineral spf), and moisturizer. I let each layer mostly dry with a fan before the next layer.

Primer: I’ve tried with out primer, with a griping primer, elf putty primer and hourglass veil primer. I’ve tried just the gripping primer, just the putty primer, just the veil primer alone. I’ve tried using the pore filling primer on my t zone and the gripping primer around the face. Sometimes I’ll spritz on a setting mist over the primer or just using a spray as the primer. I’ve tried hydro grip primer and urban decay all nighter. 

Foundation: now I know the two foundations I use have different bases but I’ve also tried them on their own and with the associated primer match. I sometimes use the lancôme teint idole ultra wear care & glow foundation or the elf glow cc cream (med/full coverage) and the fenty tinted moisturizer or the elf halo glow “foundation” sheer to light coverage. I use either a foundation brush in a buff/pat application or a damp beauty blender. Sometimes I will spray a setting spray over like milk hydro grip or peach and lily glass veil mist and I also tried a fixing spray like urban decay all nighter (this method helps the most). I’ve also not sprayed anything. I always let it dry a few min before the next application which is where it gets dicey. 😩

Cream contour or bronzer step
Ok so here is where I find out if I’m gonna have a bad or amazing make up day. 
Sometimes I just use bronzer on the high points for a little glow and sometimes I use contour, sometimes I do both. But most of the time it lifts in the shape of my brush or beauty blender or won’t blend out seamlessly and looks patchy. 
I’ve used  kilo Milano stick contour, abh contour stick and elf halo glow bronzer contour in a cool tone. I’ve applied directly to the skin and then try to blend out, I’ve applied directly to my brush then my face, I’ve applied to my brush the blended it out on the back of my hand, I’ve also applied to the back of my hand and then blend out before using tapping motions onto my cheek bones just slightly about the shadows of my face. 

I feel like I have tried everything but this new “hack” which has you applying moisturizer to the face, a thin layer of translucent powder, a setting spray (let that dry) and then a primer before foundation but that just seems crazy especially since I have dry to combo skin. 

*I’ve also tried under painting 

I was going to attach a picture showing where the make up is completely lifted, and one spot, but the rest of the face is flawless, but it won’t let me . I’m allowed to send it to anyone individually. I’m more than willing to do so because any help would be greatly appreciated.",0
1712713727.0,What's the point of bronzing drops?,"OK, just a sincere question here since I don't really get the point of it.

What's the point of bronzing drops?

I kind of get the idea of bronzer...? It adds some color and some depth and makes you look darker (the appeal of bronzer has always been a mystery to me, tbh, which is probably why I can't figure out the point of bronzer drops)? 

But I just saw an ad for a new bronzer drop product and they literally just mixed some of the drops with moisturizer and put it on. And in the end she just looked slightly darker. So why not just mix a few drops of darker foundation with moisturizer instead of getting bronzer drops? Or use self tanner?

1712689252.0,Is dewy foundation a solution for dryness?,"Hi all!

I've dug through this sub in search of some help and while it has been a great help pointing me in the right direction I haven't found an answer for my particular case.

For reference I'm a trans woman with dark facial hair, my routine as it is now is: elf orange colour corrector and L'Oreal Infallible full coverage concealer to cover up the hair shadow, set with elf halo glow setting powder, then Maybelline Fit Me matte foundation. I also use moisturizer, sunscreen, and primer to start. 

I have combo oily/dry skin, after a few hours of wear my lower face gets pretty cracked and creased. From what I've figured out this is probably because of a moisture issue. I think using setting powder worsens it. 

I'm curious if a dewy foundation could work with color corrector underneath. I know some foundations don't have enough coverage and the color of the corrector can bleed through the finished look. Could this help my dryness issue? Any alternatives around setting powder to prevent transfer of color corrector to the foundation or avoid excessive dryness? 

Any help is appreciated!

1712660641.0,Make up price increases - are products still worth it?,"Let me preface this rant-ish post by saying I understand that price increases are happening all across the board, I know luxury makeup has never been a necessity, and that you rightfully pay for quality, but...

I just can't with makeup prices anymore. I don't have a crazy collection (save for the lip department, lol) and can comfortably afford make up items. Yesterday I saw a Clinique launch I immediately liked - the new duo shadow sticks - and headed over to Sephora to see the prices, fully intending to buy one. They retailed between 33 and 38 euros! 

I would have happily forked over anything around 25 Euros, but 38 seems wildly unnecessary. I have not bought much makeup in the last year, and this has led me to reflect on why - there is very little I can justify those prices for. Even my Gucci baume, the only nude lipstick I ever loved, retails around 40 Euros... and even if I really like it, I can't justify spending that kind of money on a single item. It's not even about being sad because I can't afford it - it's because I can clearly see that even if I went to the store and purchased it, I would leave feeling disapppointed. Same with my Hourglass lip slips - gorgeous color and payoff. Is it worth 40 euros? I just don't feel it is.

I was wondering if anyone was experiencing any similar feelings of falling out of love with makeup because of the insane price hikes - I always loved it, but I am now at a point where I really don't enjoy shopping anymore.",0

1712629779.0,Favorite makeup techniques? (not products but application methods etc.),"What are your favorite makeup techniques/tips (i am basically talking everything but products). 


My tips: 

As an example i apply mascara using disposable wands to get very natural fluttery looking lashes (you use less products beacause you juuust cover each lash which is why it looks so natural and this way only product formula matters not the applicator type. Also it takes much longer for mascaras to dry out). 

For higher coverage i let products sit on the skin for a while and blend out with a brush (dense brushes are 100% the way to go for highest coverage). 

If you need to adjust the colour of foundation or anything like that you can just use eyeshadow. (making a foundation/concealer/bb/whatever less orange by adding blue, make a foundation less pink by adding green, making it less yellow by adding purple etc). Beware eyeshadow adds coverage to your cc cream, foundation, concealer. Also you can use eyeshadow as a blush, bronzer or setting powder in a pinch (obviously pick the appropriate shade).",0

so i usually wear my makeup around 10 hours a day (from about 8 until 6). i like to think it lasts for the most part (separates around my top lip and chin half way through the day), but it starts to feel very uncomfortable on my face after a few hours, mainly around my top lip and my chin, it tingles and sometimes i get a very light burning sensation, and i mean very light. its a strong tingle almost. is that normal? i work in quite a warm building, im constantly moving and sometimes i have heat directly blowing in my face (i work at an opticians and we use heat to adjust the glasses), could it be something to do with that? i do find even when im in cooler conditions it’s uncomfortable.

here’s my routine!
1) moisturise with zerobase pump action cream
2) use dr jart to cover red rosacea patches (only just above jawline, i don’t usually do anywhere else)
3) apply foundation, i use l’oréal true match foundation i try not to blend around my top lip or chin
4) conceal with the l’oréal perfect match concealer. i conceal my spot scars on my chin, spot scars on my top lip, lightly under my eyes and in between my brows
5) blush and highlight, i use elf halo glow wands
6) i pat out my creases then set with the collection powder from boots under my eyes and around my nose and sometimes around my lips
7) i do my brows with the soap and glory archery pencil and also use my brown pencil as eyeliner (am yet to buy an actual brown liner)
8) set with the elf dewy coconut setting spray

1712598606.0,Benetint but darker?,"I love Benefit's original(?) Rose shade lip tint. I'm not sure if it's just me but it seems like it has this really sheer watery formula that I love, but the other colors of Benefit Lip Tint are creamy/more opaque. I'm wondering if another brand makes a darker lip tint in an almost purple/burgundy shade.

I feel like my natural upper lip line has seriously softened/blurred from post-waxing inflammation. I have dark skin and dark purpley-brown lips, and I think a stain like that could help me make that line more crisp.

Things I love about [Benetint](https://www.benefitcosmetics.com/en-us/product/benetint-cheek-lip-stain-FM173.html):

\- very watery and sheer but buildable. I can make it sooo subtle which is nice because I don't really know how to do a full face of makeup. Without that, any one feature standing out too much looks funny to me (on my own face in the mirror, not when I'm looking at someone else who has done this!)

\- truly stains and doesn't really rub off on anything. This is great for me because I'm not used to remembering it's there and being careful with it.

1712597169.0,Dupe/replacement for L'Oréal infallible matte foundation??,"Hi everyone! Please help a girl out! So I used to wear the L'Oréal infallible matte wear foundation for years and it was perfect:

- Dried matte and I never needed powder lol
- Stayed on during my 12 hour shifts and more
- NO creases or lines
- Really good full coverage

BUT they've changed the shade and formula completely so I can no longer wear it and I'm desperately trying to find a new daily foundation for work. Or just any foundation that fits my needs.

I tried Huda Beauty's faux filter and as much as I wanted to love it, it looks so oily on me unless I powder a lot on top which I hate the feeling of and it feels a bit sticky on my face. Am I doing something wrong with this?

Does anyone know another brand/foundation that I can try instead?

I used to wear *230 honey* for the L'Oréal foundation and I was matched with the shade *Latte* for the Huda Beauty foundation if that helps.

I use moisturizer before going to bed and a little before applying makeup along with the elf power grip primer. Both my foundation (Catrice liquid coverage) and concealer (Elf Camo concealer) are water-based and I use a bit of setting powder under my eyes + setting spray

At first I thought that it may be because of dry skin but I‘ve been moisturising well and my skin doesn’t feel dry at all. I don’t know much about skincare/skin types but I think that I‘m a little oily between my eyebrows and on my nose, but it’s not a lot so I don’t think it could cause that much separation

It lists the places you can use it on the front, Sephora included. It was only $50 so I got a few small things. I used to shop there on a semi regular basis but lately I haven’t.  

When I got up to the register I gave the woman my gift card. She tried swiping it on a handheld scanner and the on the register. It kept saying there was an error. My card wasn’t worn or scratched (it was brand new) but it wouldn’t go through. She told me there wasn’t anything she could do, like type it in, since it wasn’t a Sephora gift card. Annoying but okay, I go online to buy the things I want. 

I go through the app and realize it won’t let me put my gift card in as a gift card. I have to run it as a credit card. Fine, I put it in and go to check out. My total is over $50 so I try putting my credit card in to pay the balance. Nope. You can’t split payments between credit cards. 

I email customer service hoping to get it resolved. Their response was since it’s a third party gift card it has to be run as a credit card and there is no way to split payments between credit cards. They then suggested I buy a Sephora gift card with the happy card. 

I did the same thing on the Ulta app and magically they allow you to use third party gift cards as gift cards. Maybe I’m over reacting but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.  So now I have $6 on a gift card. I’ll just go to one of the other places on there to use it but I’m just annoyed. ",0

Just turned 35 and I feel like what I used to think looks good on me just doesn’t land anymore. I used to feel like I could wear a winged liner or winged out eyeshadow shape all the time and now I can’t figure it out. I’ve tried big, small, thick, thin liner and they all just look weird to me. Anytime I do a winged shadow shape it looks weirdly like a comma on my eyes instead of a straight line (does that make sense). Took some photos of some makeup I thought looked good (photo 1 and 2) when I was doing it but then something feels off (mostly liner), so the third and fourth photos are after I wiped off most of the liner.

I like to wear both “natural” and “glam” makeup, but am I destined to just stay in a more natural space? I know I can wear whatever makes me happy and I really don’t care what people think of my makeup but I would like to have it look more flattering for my features.

1712507706.0,Brown Adjacent Nude Blushes???,"So to me a ""nude blush"" is almost like the blush equivalent of a nude lip, something that is the same vibe as your natural skin tone/colour, with a *slight* bit of ""unnatural"" colour (red, pink, orange, purple etc) added. 

However, every blush described as a ""nude blush"" is quite beige-adjacent. It used to be like that for ""nude"" lip products before but the offerings for deep skin are so much better now.

1712505758.0,Sheer-Light Coverage just won’t work on me!!,"Good morning, beautiful and knowledgeable beauty community!! 

I am having an issue with several lighter coverage complexion products I’ve tried.  Although I do have a dry skin type, and texture, the issue I am having is that the complexion products I’ve been trying are accentuating texture/wrinkles and maybe dry patches, I didn’t even know I had. Lol I say “maybe dry patches” because I genuinely don’t know what it is! I exfoliate fairly regularly, prep my skin very well before application, but it never fails, the thinner skin tints, tinted moisturizers, or lower coverage foundations that I WANT to work for me, end up making my skin look much, much worse than it is naturally! 

I’ve gotten to the point (age) that I am going for a lower coverage, more natural look than I used to.  So, I have been trying more lower coverage products. This morning I tried the Rare Beauty Positive Light Tinted Moisturizer and it immediately started “grabbing” and showing texture that you can’t see OR feel on my bare face! I do have maturing skin, so I have pores, wrinkles, fine lines. But I truly don’t have a huge issue with those showing. My main goal in wearing a base/complexion product is to minimize the redness in my skin. My plan this morning was to wear the tinted moisturizer all over and add extra coverage with my Tower 28 Serum Concealer. But after taking pictures in desperation to bring to you talented individuals, I had to immediately wash it all off! 

The Rare Beauty tinted moisturizer isn’t the only complexion product that does this on me either. Some others are: Iconic London Super Smoother Blurring Skin Tint, Tower 28 Sunny Days Tinted Sunscreen, Saie Slip Tint Tinted Moisturizer, & Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow.

These products look so beautiful on so many different skin types, including those much more mature than mine. People are constantly raving about all of them and their reviews are endless. I just can’t figure out why they won’t work for me, despite trying several different primers and on bare (well moisturized) skin.

The only products I have found SOME success with are Clinique Even Better Makeup & Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can get these to work on my skin? Or should I just give up and come to terms with being stuck wearing medium-full coverage products forever?!

NOTE: I have photos but it says I’m not allowed to attach them. 😕

My skin has become dryer with age and new medication. 

I was previously using:

1. Nars sheer glow foundation in Siberia

2. Unseen sunscreen prior to having dry skin, but it wasn’t moisturizing enough after. I’ve started using EltaMD but it pills with my foundation.  

3. Need a primer recommendation— the unseen screen was doing double duty. 

Product needs:

1. Wide range of shades. I’m VERY pale. For reference, the lightest shade of Nars Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer is too dark and leaves a noticeable orange cast/difference in shade from my neck/chest. I have this problem often when trying to find a shade match. Let me know if I should add a photo. 

2. Products don’t pill when layered. I find this is the hardest and is why I came to you beautiful gurus. 

3. Price point: For items that I KEEP, I’m not super concerned with price. Meaning that the item needs to come in a sample size that I can try or be return/exchangeable.

1. My skin isn't really nice. Sebaceous filaments all over and it's most visible in my U Zone and around and on the nose. Some places have acne and its combo skin.

2. I'm asian. Not the biggest eyes with epicanthic folds, literally yellowish-pale skin. downturned and fuller lower lips, but not the biggest either. my nose is just a straight nose? kinda snub maybe.

3. more details in my eyes (since i want to do some eye makeup), its not the typical asian eye? no it doesn't have double eyelids instead it has epicanthic folds. but the bottom of my eye has this weird space? below them. it's not eyebags or anything, its literally this space under my eyes and my lower lashes just sit on top of them. it connects my epicanthic folds and it creates this huge natural eyeliner i guess. i've had them since i was born, theyre like part of my eye. that included is my eye shape. ive been searching so long but i cant find the name.

4. i dont know how to do skincare under 
makeup. makeup itself feels really sticky and annoying to me and skincare makes it even stickier so idk what to do. every time i put on makeup, i use the elf poreless putty primer. doesnt really help and it makes it oily. then i put on kosa bb cream and its honestly so patchy. i use wet n wild photofocus setting spray. i use the rare beauty highlighter and put on cream blush. i use a makeup puff to blend everything out by the way. i put on more setting spray and thats it. i gave up on mascara since my lashes are short anyway. is it wrong? i need tips and new makeup stuff to buy so i can perfect it.

side note - i want to go for a natural look, nothing too much and perfect for school.

I love multichrome/color shift glitter eyeshadows, so as you’d expect Karla Cosmetics kept coming across my social media feeds. I decided to try just a couple of products out: a duo chrome loose eyeshadow, and their Fix Potion Glitter Eye Primer. I’ve been previously using the NYX glitter primer which works great, but every time I purchase it the packaging splits before I’m even halfway through it so I’m throwing out an almost full tube because the product is drying out. I’ve been looking out for something to replace it and was hoping this was it.

I have tried every way I can think of to use this primer, and it honestly seems like it does absolutely nothing. When applying it on top of eyeshadow to add the glitter, it takes all my eyeshadow right off. I’ve tried applying the loose eyeshadow to it when it’s still wet, let it dry a little so it just felt tacky, and even mixing it with the powder. It just looks like sheer blue glitter, barely visible, no shift, and it ends up all over my glasses and my face within an hour. I tried these methods with some of my pressed Terra Moons eyeshadows just as sort of an experiment, and even those end up all over the place with this primer. This never happened with the NYX.

It seems like everyone in all the reviews absolutely loves this stuff, which is making me suspect maybe I’m doing something wrong. Has anyone had better luck with this product? If you have any suggestions for anything better, I’m open to that as well. Thanks!",0

I guess I've been out of the loop drama wise as per usual, but it seems Kat Von D herself left her company for some reason or another a while ago, and in my experience at least the makeup hasn't been the same whatsoever. The new shade is pretty, but too dark to get that ""my lip but better"" look. Lolita's been my go to shade for ages, like literally since I was a teensy little teenybopper.

What is the lippie everyone is splurging for during the ulta beauty sale vs sephora?

I'm debating between clarins lip oil ( not sire which one apricot or yes honey)  vs the ole henreikhsen one ( strawberry ? ) 

. Something i can wear overnight would be ideal. Or should i go for the summer fridays  one ? The mint one is cute 

But the hourglass phantom sticks look really pretty too. I'm confused I like the mint/menthol feeling I get from the elf lips oils 

I'm a insider at sephora so I want to take advantage of the ulta prestige brands 20 percent off. 

For other non lippies . Searching for a undereye setting powder.

I’m very fair and i also love the outdoors, so unsurprisingly my dermatologist said my face, chest, and arms are very sun damaged and i need to start wearing sunscreen daily. 

All of the sunscreens I’ve seen require reapplication every 2 hours or less. About 50% of the time i put sunscreen on before makeup, but i have to start reapplying especially on days when im outside (which is every day unless it’s raining).

How do y’all reapply sunscreen over your makeup? Do you just get a spray sunscreen? Or just rub it on and touch up your makeup? My makeup currently consists of concealer, blush, mascara, brow pencil, a lip product or two, and sometimes eyeshadow. So rubbing a sunscreen on there will make my blush and concealer slide off or look muddy and weird.

Any thoughts on the milani conceal and perfect blur out powder? ",0

1712370604.0,Eyes hurting because of makeup?,"So recently my eyes have been feeling irritated and hurting whenever I put on makeup and kind of when I do my skincare and I don’t think it’s both or at least not causing it I don’t know because I’ve been using the same product brands and recently got new products so I don’t think it’s the ingredients or from being expired. And today I threw away my beauty blender and eyelash curler because those 2 things specifically I’ve been using it ever since I started using and getting into makeup but I threw it away. Also I usually get allergies around this time of year, so what could it be that is causing my eyes to be feeling like that?  Was it because of the beauty blender and eyelash curler? Allergies? Both?

*Side note:
• I don’t wear eyeshadow.
• I’ve been using less products more specifically concealer and try avoiding getting any makeup overall in my eyes.
• It’s mostly my right eye and has been extremely watery. 
• From where I live, it has been recently windy.
• The products I use around my eyes is the fit me foundation, concealer, and press powder, and a waterproof mascara. Sometimes i put highlighter in the corners of my eyes but recently haven’t been putting some on.

1712334091.0,Products that surprised you?,"Which products have surprised you (good or bad)?

I'll start with some of my standouts.


Good surprises:

- Clinique's ""High Impact"" mascara

I was gifted some Clinique products (which I'm not a big fan of) and my usual mascara dried out so I used it out of desperation. It is the most natural looking mascara I have ever used. It doesn't look like I'm wearing mascara, it looks like I got my eyelashes tinted or am wearing super natural falsies. It is so effortless to apply and doesn't clump up AT ALL. It's such a good every day mascara if you're going for a no-makeup/minimal makeup look. I would have never tried this product if it hadn't been gifted to me but I'm going to purchase it now.

- Aquaphor as chapstick

I don't know why I didn't try this sooner. I've always struggled with chapped lips and have never found a chapstick that left my lips feeling truly moisturized. I finally googled ""what do dermatologists recommend for chapped lips"" and found Aquaphor as a suggestion and holy crap it's amazing. My lips look so much less wrinkly now because they're moisturized and protected for the first time in my life, lol. My fiance even commented on how nice my lips have looked lately.

- Wet n Wild Tinted Hydrator

Honestly I like this foundation more than nearly all other ones I've tried. It may not have the extreme lasting power of some other ones (it'll start to break down and settle in my problem areas by the end of the day), but it looks so pretty on the skin. I put this on and my fiance and future MIL both commented on how flawless my skin looked. She's a bit of a luxury brand makeup snob and she was demanding to know what foundation I was wearing because she said my skin looked like porcelain.



Bad surprises:

- IT Cosmetics CC cream

Ew. Thick, nasty, greasy. I'm so confused when I see people recommend it. Waste of money.

- IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereye corrector

Same thing! Thick, greasy formula that creased like crazy on me. It looked so heavy and unflattering. I did not understand the hype at all. Waste of money.

- Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara

It looked nice I guess, but it is literally the only mascara I have ever had issues with transfer and smudging. Did not repurchase. The Loreal Lash Paradise mascara is just as good, if not better, and doesn't smudge or flake on me like this did.

My overthinking is killing me. I really like them and would be devastated if they don’t last at least 3 years 🥹 I have been doing makeup in college which is 5 years and never experienced any shredding on real techniques, Ecotools and Zoeva. They all survived my weekly deep cleaning routine. However I recently have a job and I bought my dream brushes. They are pricey so I just have to ask from experienced people.

One more question, any suggestion on good foundation brush under $60? For reference I love my zoeva 118 but I dropped it and the shaped is kinda changed a little bit. I’m eyeing hourglass soft glow and mac 170s.

The only base/face makeup I do is concealer under my eyes and on my blemishes, and then blush. I used to do more makeup but now I prefer to keep it simple. however, I have an issue where my upper lip area always has at least a bit of redness and my normal concealer doesn't work for it. My upper lip area has a bit of a dryish/bumpy texture even when I use extra moisturizer on the area, so the concealer often doesn't blend well on top of it, and even when I still use it despite this it doesn't cover up the redness very well. I've tried looking for green color correctors but the vast majority of them seem to be intended to use under foundation/some kind of base and would look too green to use alone. I see Dr Jarts being talked about a lot, but I've read from a lot of reviews that it doesn't actually work well on dry skin so it doesn't seem like that would work for me. I'm considering the erborian cc red correct, but will I be able to just use it on my upper lip? Or will I have to use it all over my face to make it look even? Any recs would be appreciated!",0

Back when I was an early teen, I borrowed my mom's makeup (nothing offensive, mostly Chapstick and shimmery eye shadow). One day we were at a museum, and I bent over a device you'd put a penny in for donations, and out of my purse fell a specific piece of makeup I had borrowed without asking permission. It was gone forever, and to this day I feel bad I lost it. I've always wanted to find it again and replace it, but we've come to the issue: I can't remember the brand! I'm hoping that by giving enough info, someone here might know what I'm talking about, so here we go!

* I'm almost certain it was a trio (but it could be a quad) of shimmery eyeshadow
* colors: white/champagne shade, a light brown and a dark brown
* the palette was small and rectangular, the pan was deep and the lid wasn't screwed in place, it could be removed completely. The material of the palette was clear plastic/acrylic and the colors within the palette touched, they were not devided.
* I vaguely remember it being an Elizabeth Arden brand, but when I search online I can't find anything resembling what I have in mind, so I'm guessing it's not that brand after all. I also looked into almay but didn't find what I was looking for either. As you might guess, my mom didn't shop in the high end makeup section, but you never know, she was reallyyyy upset when I lost this specific piece of makeup
* I'm 31 now and this happened when I was around 12? And since it belonged to my mother we can guess it was a pretty old piece of makeup, she wasn't one to buy such things frequently.

I think thats the max amount of info I can give in this post! My mom has M.S. now, so her memory can't recall such details, but I'm really hoping collectively we might find it!!! 🙏 Thanks in advance for any help!

Edit: I'm from Canada, Quebec, and I added a drawing of what I remember the packaging looked like!

1712259337.0,Milani Stay Put Infinite Liner works wayyy too well. ,"I bought Milani Stay Put Infinite Liner because reviews said that it's pretty indestructible. Even on Reddit it was pretty well received. The formula was changed, and then changed back (more or less, recent reviews were mostly cries of joy that it's back).

Well it works too well in the staying department IMO. Anything I used, I had to SCRUB to get it off. Micellar water, 3 different cleansing balms, make up remover, cleanser. All had great reception in removing make up. My other stuff came off flawlessly. Holding it for a minute didn't work. It's my first liquid liner, so I thought that was just how this type of formula worked. 

I then got another version of Milani's liquid liner. Off in 2 rubs with make up remover and it didn't budge beforehand so it's not like it has terrible staying power.

How do you Milani cultists get the Stay Put Infinite Liner off? ",0

Which is a look I'm personally not a huge fan off.

Generally I just want a very casual look that looks more natural without clumps. Like my natural eyelashes but just *slightly* more enhanced. As I do find that naked eye-lashes can look weird if I'm wearing a full face of make-up.

My current daily makeup - I use my SPF (Beauty of Joseon relief sun) as a primer, Chanel No.1 De Chanel foundation, Nars radiant creamy concealer (only for eyes though). 

I understand that I’m using the wrong spf as it’s more cream based. I’ve cycled through Estee Lauder Doublewear, Dior forever skin glow, and now Chanel (i have sensitive skin which is why I’m selective with brands - although it’s costly!). Nothing has worked or lasted long so far. 

I also know that setting powder and setting spray are important but I’m a bit lost on where to start.

1712179810.0,Looking for colourful and/or shimmery eyeshadow reccs that are buildable and apply + last well without primer.,"Hey, so I'm more of a minimal products type of person, I don't use complexion products at all besides liquid blush or bronzer. And this is because I'm autistic and have a sensory sensitivity to having too much product on, especially if it feels thick or not skin breathable. 

That being said I'm very heavy on the eye makeup, and lean towards heavy eyeliner looks and smokey eyeshadows (blacks, cool browns). I trend towards more buildable and sheer formulas as I find high pigment to be very jarring when I don't use foundation. My holy grail eyeshadow for everyday makeup atm is Bobbi Brown Cream Eyeshadow Stick in Bark. I also use alot of Korean and Japanese eyeshadows because they are buildable and are generally made to be worn without primer. The problem is I'm sick of sticking to neutrals and nudes. 

However, I've always wanted to do more colorful, fairy-like eyeshadow looks, especially for spring summer. Colors like white shimmer, subtle iridescent shades, blues, greens, purples and turquoise. I've tried some Japanese and Korean brands for these colors but they really suck in staying power because I guess their formulas work best for nudes. 

Please give me reccomendations for brands, formulas to look out for or specific shades! My skin tone is medium olive (I'm East Asian but I like tanning). Also I prefer single shadows or quads over huge palettes because I'm trying to keep my collection small. I live between the UK and Japan so brands available in these places will be appreciated.

When I started my Fit Me shade search I did not have the NARS foundation yet and the only shade reference I had was the MAC NC20 shade. After trusting Findation and adding the MAC shade NC20 in its system I got the Fit Me shade 128 and I bought and tried it and it was obviously too dark and warm on me.
Then after getting matched with the NARS Gobi at Sephora and learning my undertone is neutral and leaning to yellow, I went and ordered the Fit Me shade 124 which is a little bit lighter than the 128 l had tried and in the neutral group of tones (more specifically in the neutral cools), once again it was too dark for me.
So which shade do you recommend I try now? The 120 shade is in the neutral cools as well but I don't know if it's still too dark. I don't feel like trying the shades that are lighter than the 120 because those shades are in either the warm or cool undertones (except for the 112 and 102 which I'm sure would be too pale for me).

My base looks decent and hydrated, I guess, when u apply all my cream products, but as soon as I put powder on via setting/baking... I look a mess. The makeup looks dull and like a completely different colour and so thick and ugly

Also, I'm not using pale powder. My powders are dark brown, and I have a lighter one, too, with a more yellowish tone for brightness. I use the last two shades of the sleek setting powder for reference. 

I've tried sort of moistening it up with setting spray after, but it just leaves a sheen that doesn't do the job. My main problem is whenever I try to dust the setting powder off...it dosen't come off...so imagine you bake and the powder just stays there and in that exact shape too....Awful.

1712134183.0,Pressed face powder recommendations,"Hi all. I'm looking for a new pressed powder to wear daily. I do not want a full coverage powder foundation or a setting powder... I prefer a more light up to medium coverage powder and I like having it in compact form so I can keep it in my bag. I've tried many drugstore and prestige powders but as of the past few years I feel like everything is either just a very light setting powder or a super full coverage foundation. I do not wear foundation daily, just some concealer for my dark circles and I set that with a Laura Mercier loose eye powder. I'd prefer something I could buy at Ulta, Macy's, or a drugstore as those stores are closest to me. I already have loose setting powders for whenever I do a glam look for occasions.


It's been over ten years now maybe but back in my early twenties Revlon used to sell the Nearly Naked powder and that was my absolute favorite. It had such a soft silky texture and made my face look airbrushed without needing any other products layered under it. It didn't last all day in oily parts of my face but I don't care about needing to touch up every so often. I've never found anything like that powder again. I still have an okay powder from besame that I use currently but that was also discontinued. Right now I'm using the Maybelline fitme or Revlon photo ready but neither are as good as that old Revlon one. I can't remember the last time I ordered a prestige brand as I feel like none of them offer a regular pressed powder anymore, it's all powder foundation or translucent setting powders.",0

my skin is pretty normal but it gets kinda dry as the day goes on, and i know switching to a water based routine as opposed to a silicone based routine will probably be better for my skin type. however i started using the hourglass airbrush concealer and i absolutely fell in love it it, it's the only concealer for me that doesn't crease insanely by the end of the day. i would hate to have to switch off of my concealer and start experimenting with different ones again, so if possible i would like to keep it. 

for reference, right now im using the rare beauty pore diffusing primer, and while i love the way it makes my skin feel very smooth and ""primed"", it just takes all the glow away and i feel like my skin dries out so much faster. any help?? :,)

1712099494.0,I had to throw everything out. Now seeking new holy grails!,"Hi there friends

**TLDR — I had pink eye I need all new makeup and need help.**

About 1.5 months ago I got really sick. One of my worst symptoms from this virus was pink eye. First time in my life that has ever happened to me and it was pretty severe. It hurt SO MUCH from the swelling. I looked like I’d been beaten, it was AWFUL!! From what I heard it usually clears up on its own (when it’s due to a virus not from poo-poo in your eyeballs) but for me that was not the case and I eventually had to go to the doctor to get it figured out. Blah blah blah, I’m fine it cleared up

Doctor told me to throw away all of my makeup, and I was a little bit hesitant to do that because I really don’t wear makeup a lot. I never wore any when I was sick with those symptoms. I stupidly was like “meh, I’ll give it a while and just sanitize my stuff and I’ll be OK.” — Went to a party and put on a SMALL amount of mascara (that’s all!) — bloop bloop, here’s the goop again. Not severe but enough to make me realize I really do need to dump all my products.

Which leads me to you wonderful gurus!! I see this as an opportunity to reset my life and buy products that are actually GOOD and not just random things that I’ve acquired over the years. I had some OLD SHIT… I’m 34 and I have a good job these days so I’m OK with making a decent investment in my looks.

Also, I’m pretty sure I should dump ALL of my makeup not just the things that are just for the eyes. Like they all were mixed up in my bag so I just feel like it’s better to fully reset everything.

*Here is my list of what I would like in my little beauty bag:*

* **Regular Black Mascara**
   * (*Previous product:* Thrive Causemetics Liquid Lash Extensions Mascara… I was gifted this and I quite liked it.) — I like that it doesn’t smear. I have hooded eyes so my lashes smear super bad if they’re not a tubing or waterproof formula…
* **Eyebrow Pencil**
   * (*Previous product:* NYX Eyebrow Powder Pencil) — I prefer pencils not brushes…
* **Liquid Eyeliner**\- (*Previous product:* Stila micro-tip) — also another product I really liked. But open to anything easy to apply.
* **Eye primer**
   * (*Previous product*: Urban Decay eyeshadow Primer Potion) — I just need to keep my wings in place bc I touch my face a lot.
* **Shimmery Bronzey Eye Pencil**
   * (*Previous product*: some random Covergirl pencil) — more for basic every day look.
* **Shimmery Bronzey-Goldy Eyeshadow Palette**
   * (*Previous Product:* IDK!) — I just really like a nice subtle nude-ish shimmer and but also similar lighter and darker tones.
* **Fun Summery BRIGHT Eyeshadows**
   * (*Previous Product*: Kimchi Cosmetics, forget the name, but think fun disco Aqua and very bright yellows and greens.) — I only do this once in a while but I love it…
* **Blush**
   * (*Previous Products*: Pixi tinted moisture stick / an ancient MAC pot) — If I wear any makeup I go for blush first. It makes me look alive so I’d love to get a good one.
* **Is there anything I’m forgetting?**

Thank you if you read through all of that. Those are the bare necessities that I need. That being said, since you’re here… Here are my “nice to haves”

&#x200B;

* F**un colored ACTUALLY PIGMENTED mascaras**
   * Similar to above, I’ll do a funky look SOMETIMES. I love blue and green and purple mascaras but I’ve been so disappointed in the few that I bought in recent years. I hate buying them and then they’re just… not even remotely clockable as blue or purple. I want VIVID!
* **SPF Setting Spray**
   * I don’t wear foundation so I usually just put on SPF underneath, but it’d be nice to have it be a LAST STEP instead of the first step. I’m very interested in the “Vacation” brand. It’s very much a “that’s so me” vibe but I don’t wanna buy into the hype unless someone sells me on it.
* **Tinted SPF moisturizer or similar.**
   * I’m white but kinda olive-ish. I’ll never be a full coverage girly but I could probably use a little bit of light-weight concealer.
* **White pencil eyeliner**
   * idk I heard it’s coming back into fashion.
* **ONE general face cleanser**
   * I have other things for skincare but I would like to have a holy grail face cleanser. I always kinda liked Cerave but lately… idk I feel like I should upgrade.
* **Orange Blossom or Jasmine scented fragrance**
   * I love floral scents. Vanilla, sugar-y scents are not for me. Clean, floral, fresh. Hints of citrus acceptable.

It’s just makeup I’m a bit clueless about.)

What are your favorite primers, foundations, setting sprays or powders, concealers, blushes, etc.?  Are creme or powder products better? How do I know if a product is silicon/oil/water/etc. based?  And which kinds should not be used together? 

I bought the ilia super serum because it was recommended to me, but I’m not sure if i like it… it kinda has a weird smell. I do like how sheer and natural it is (since my skin is in good shape, i don’t need too much coverage) and i love that it has an SPF, but it makes me look greasy. (I know it’s supposed to be dewy, but it’s a bit too much.) I didn’t want to toss it so I went back and got a mattifying primer for underneath.. it immediately went patchy looking.  So I went back again and got a setting powder but then it made me look cakey.  I’m just at a loss.. Is there another foundation that’s better or one that i can mix it with to tone down the shininess and maybe slightly increase the coverage? How can i tell if they’ll be compatible? I don’t want them to separate or turn flaky on my skin if i mix them..

I definitely believe in higher quality products so i don’t mind spending money if they’re worth it. I would just rather not waste money on products that end up not working.

1712108331.0,"What do you recommend for a dewy glowy natural look? I have very dry and sensitive skin, so it’s hard to look well-hydrated and glowing. Want to change my everyday look to something more simple. ","For some reason, it won’t let me attach a photo to show my everyday makeup, so I will try to post it in the comments. 

Aside from moisturizer and primer, I use liquid foundation (medium coverage) or tinted moisturizer, blush (it’s a cream), sometimes highlighter (also a cream), and either a setting spray or powder (it’s not more glowy with one versus the other - it looks the same).

Any holy grails for someone with really dry skin that wants to look dewy and glowing? 

Thinking about serums, thermal mist (if that’s what it’s called), anything hydrating and illuminating. 

Preferably a new highlighter too that is more glowing than glittery (if such a thing exists). I currently use the Anastasia Beverly Highlighter Stick (which I love), but doesn’t give me that overall glowing look - nor is that its purpose.

 I am looking for a new full coverage foundation. I was just wondering if anyone had any recommendations? Previously, I was using tarte- their face tape liquid and also their Amazonian clay cream type foundation, which I absolutely loved. It made my skin look so beautiful. It is definitely full coverage but didn’t feel full coverage, if that makes sense. and hardly transferred . Unfortunately, I just was having trouble finding the correct shade with them because I am very fair, and they tend to run kind of orangey so I switched to Mac and the color match is SO good (NW10) but I do not like the way it sits on my skin and it transfers a lot too. Looking for something that’s full coverage that will make my skin feel very soft and smooth, not sticky, and is transfer resistant. Prefer matte over dewy but it’s not a deal breaker

1711939690.0,Help! Wedding makeup failing me ,"I am in a bit of a crisis as I am 5 days out from my wedding and my wedding makeup is starting to fail me!! 

For clarity - I am doing my own makeup. 

I have been practicing my wedding makeup using foundation brushes for my foundation application and it’s been great (stippling it on and then buffing to blend it out a bit). 

But, for some reason, this weekend in my final practice rounds before my wedding Friday, the foundation is getting all splotchy and patchy looking. I have changed nothing in my process. 

So after the first fail, I started to test different primers and moisturizers to see if they would impact it, but all my primers are now making it look worse, so now I’m just sticking with moisturizer. 

I then tried using a damp makeup sponge, that was better but not great. 

Then in a last ditch effort of frustration, I slathered it on with my fingers and oh my god it worked better than it ever has. I used the damp sponge to blend out some spots, but after a day of wear it looks great still and I am baffled. 

Am I crazy for using my fingers to apply foundation??? 

Am I messing something up with the brushes all of a sudden? 

Is it my products just not working for my face anymore? 

Foundation Products being used: 
The ordinary moisturizer 
Il Makiage foundation 
Maybeline instance age rewind eraser concealer for under eye color correction

I found a super cool video on YouTube that showed me how to find out my color season by analyzing my skin, eye, and hair color (turns out I’m an Autumn). I did some more digging and found that warmer colors suit me best (deep oranges, mustard yellow, warm greens, rich browns, etc.) the eyeshadow palette I have is probably over a decade old and has lots of colors that I never use and knowing the color palette I should have now, I’m hoping you guys could give me some suggestions on eyeshadow palettes that have as many fall colors as possible. A wide range of colors on the palette is preferred so I don’t have to spend so much buying multiple sets.

I know make up can be expensive and I don’t wear eyeshadow much so I’m willing to spend a decent amount if it’s good quality and has a range of colors. I don’t know how much exactly make up costs but I wouldn’t be opposed to spending around $80 for a big palette. Again, I don’t want to wear too much make up at a time as I like a bit more natural (light coverage foundation, maybe some blush and highlighter and that’s usually it), but if there’s anything else you think would be good to get that’s not a lot of work, please let me know!",0

1711913676.0,HG foundations for oily skin???,"Im currently a girly with no foundation.
My concealer that I use is the dior forever skin correct and I love it. It’s water based so im preferably looking for a water based foundation. I am aware that silicone based is better for oily skin so I could do that too, I can make it work.

My preference is medium/light coverage. However, I probably won’t be wearing it that often so good go for medium-full for occasions and sheer it out when I want to.

Price point is not too much of an issue, have been looking at lancome tient idole but people say the reformulation is bad :(

im not from the us and where i live there isnt any sephora and the makeup stores are usually expensive. Recently i went to the US and bought some things in sephora (i felt like a lost puppy because i know nothing of makeup haha). I just bought a concealer that one of the girls working there told me it was good (the brand is ILIA), the liquid blush from rare beauty, the highlighter (the one thats like powder) also from rare beauty, the lip sleeping mask from launeige, a setting spray and a brush and one beauty blender. I also have a mascara and lots of lip glosses lol

So the thing is, i dont know if that enough?? like i see a bunch of girls in pinterest and ig using setting powder but i dont know if that’s necessary????
