1712791398.0,[acne] hormonal acne after getting iud / stopping BC pill,"Hi 
I got an IUD 5ish months ago and have been breaking out horribly ever since along my chest, back, neck, jaw. I looked it up and this is all due to hormonal acne. I was on the birth control pill before the IUD so not sure if the breakouts are due to stopping the pill or starting the IUD.

I feel like I had a good and easy skincare routine before that was pretty simple - face rinse, AHA, moisturizer, and spf in the morning and cerave SA cleanser wash, retinol, moisturizer at night. 

When I started breaking out badly, I started using the cerave hydrating oil cleanser face wash every night because I saw good things online about it and switched to using the cerave SA cleaner every other day instead. This didn’t help and maybe even made my skin feel worse. It feels like I need to find an entirely new routine now. 

I had isolated breakouts before but nothing like now where I have entire areas of my body breaking out in dozens of big and small red pimples and closed comedones, which I only learned about after I started getting them a few months ago. None of it is cystic but it’s uncomfortable and unsightly. I know sometimes it takes years for people to find the right routine and it’s only been a few months for me but I’m just hoping to get my clear skin back! Any tips on how to manage this?

1712790277.0,[Acne] Retinols burns,"Epiduo and retinol burns

I need help with my skin. It isn't tolerating any actives anymore. 
I have moderate acne and took one course of Accutane in 2019. The acne game back even worse. 2021 I was diagnosed with PCOS years after my cystic acne started thriving..

For several months after finishing accutane course, I was perscribed topical isotritinoin forever, which was going well until it was suddenly retrieved from all pharmacies in my country for about 6 months. I had no spare tubes so naturally I stopped. 
As soon as it was back in pharmacies I bought 0.025% and started slowly again exactly how I did first time. 2 weeks in my entire face started burning. Had to stop. 

Took a break until Oct 2023, focused on diet, lifestyle changes etc. which helped a little, but I needed an active to clear my skin. Went to another dermatologist and was perscribed epiduo. 

Started slowly, once a week then twice a week then every two nights then every other night. Last three days I experienced slight tingling which I brushed away as nothing for my skin was used to epiduo by then. Tonight was the thereshold, burning all over my face seconds after applying epiduo, I had to wash immediately and applied moisturiser while wet. The burning was still there, so I washed my face with cold water and applied fucidin, a corticosteroid topical cream which I kept for emergencies. Burning was reduced now 20mins later, but still there. 

What do I do now ? Is it possible that my skin will never tolerate any actives again ? I was always told to keep it simple but cleanser, moistursier sunscreen never felt enough. 

I also have oily skin that gets clogged pores often so the only moisturiser I can use without getting new pimples is sensilis hydra essence. While it doesn't clog pores it doesn't feel like it is moisturising enough.

1712780481.0,[Acne] A kid told me acne happens due to hand touching face.,"Weird thing a kid told me when i was a kid too.

I was suffering with very rough acne when I was 13-14 and coincidentally that was puberty age and I was a normal boy. It's famous in my country that excessive masturbation causes acne but I couldn't find any scientific evidence so naturally denied it. A friend of mine who knew too much about many things compared to us told me that when you masturbate, bacteria stays on your hand that causes acne when it touches face and no matter how much you wash it, that bacteria will stay there for a week or two. I believed him and stopped touching my face and again coincidentally acne stopped after a while. That stuck with me and anytime I found my left hand near my face, I remembered it and removed my hand. I grew up and once when I thought about it, I knew 1000% that was fake because no way a bacteria like that can resist soap and stuff. But acne started again when I ignored hand on my face and this has happened quite a few times. I still find it very weird and avoid touching my face with left hand but another side of me know this is fake. Your thoughts?",SkincareAddiction

About a year and a half ago a friend bought me some skincare products after I noticed a wrinkle on my forehead and freaked out. I was using the Cerave AM/PM/Hydrating Cleanser and an OTC retinol at night 3-4 times a week for the first year and then over the last 6ish months I substituted the OTC retinol for tretinoin from HIMS which is compounded (0.055% tret, 5% azalaic acid and 4% niacinimide) so now I do:  
  
AM:  
  
\- Just rinse my face with water and apply the Cerave AM  
  
PM:  
  
\- wash my face with Cerave Hydrating cleanser  
  
\- Put on Cerave PM  
  
\- Put on the compounded tret every other night

1712780394.0,[acne] [PSA] Beware the Winlevi withdrawal,"WINLEVI WITHDRAWAL story:

  
Hello! Now that my skin has finally recovered (1 year later) I feel that I need to share this with the internet. I experienced mild hormonal acne throughout my 20s. Never wanted to go on spiro, so when Winlevi came out I was super excited for a topical hormonal option. I used Winlevi cream morning and night on my cheeks and jaw as instructed. For the first 3 months my skin looked AMAZING! No pimples, all my pie vanished - truly perfect skin. But then... after month 3 I started getting breakouts again. I had read online that people had experiences with their skin going back to normal or getting worse on winlevi after 3 months, so I was nervous that Winlevi was making my skin worse. So I stopped applying it....

  
3 days later, all heck broke loose. I woke up and my skin was itchy, red, and dry. (only on my cheeks and chin/jaw - not my nose or forehead where I hadn't been applying the winlevi). I thought maybe I got a sunburn - although I hadn't been in the sun and I always wear sunscreen anyways. Over the next few weeks my skin barrier DETERIORATED. My skin was so sensitive that I couldn't even GET IT WET! It would flare up when I put ANY product on it. So not even any sunscreen, makeup, soothing anything. I got all new gentle Avene products and even that irritated it. I fell into a depression because I couldn't shower, go outside (no sunscreen) or really do anything because my face just HURT and ITCHED. Even the air hurt it from just taking a walk. And to top it all off, because of how irritated my skin was I got the WORSTE HORMONAL ACNE BREAKOUT OF MY LIFE! (I think I had never truley experienced full blown acne until this ordeal, omg) The scars it has left...oof. My skin barrier was just non-existant during this time. It was so dry, like soooo dry. 

  
I went to my derm and she just said: ""winlevi wouldn't do that, you should just continue to apply it"" - um no. After about 2 months of my skin being EXTREMELY reactive and also randomly flaring up in hives (only on my cheeks and chin) - it finally started to calm down. I would wash with only cold water - barely any face wash. It took forever to go back to normal - but eventually, after 6 months (!) I am kind of back to normal. I occasionally get a bit red if I take a shower that is too warm, but for the most part I can use my normal products again. 

  
When this was happening, I was just in survival mode. But now, looking back on it, IT WAS 100% SOME KIND OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE WINLEVI. I talked with my derm before using it to make sure it was not a steroid because I'm aware that TSW exists, and she assured me it wasn't. WELL - WINLEVI IS A STEROID! It's not the same type of steroid that is linked with TSW, but still.... I had all the symptoms that line up with TSW.   


PLEASE - if you had a similar experience with Winlevi please comment. And if you are using Winlevi and it's working for you - great - but just beware of what might happen when you stop. There was NO warning of any kind of withdrawal like this. If I had known this was a possibility I would never tried it.   


I have pictures of the entire process - I'm not super keep to share them with the internet but I can if people want. idk. It's kinda traumatic to look back at haha. 

  
TLDR: After using Winlevi cream for acne on my face for 3 months, I stopped using the cream and experienced withdrawal side effects similar to TSW. It took 6 months for my skin to fully heal. Please do not use this new cream - or if you do just know this is a possibility if you stop taking it!",SkincareAddiction

Should I be using the soap with anything else cause right now I’m just using the soap and a moisturizer. 3. Since I’ve started, I’ve been keeping the soap on my face for one minute and 30 seconds and this is because I feel absolutely no tingle or burn when using black african soap so I was wondering if my tolerance is built from the panoxyl or what?

my skin barrier is a wreck, my skin is constantly red, irritated, and my moisture retention is absolutely 0

Round lab Dokdo sunscreen 


PM

1712775896.0,[Product question] Does switching from tret to a low strength retinol cause purging?,"I had to 'give up' my prescribed 0.25 tretinoin and clindamycin gel due to problems with obtaining this medication.

1712775598.0,[Product Request] looking for a particular hand scrub or something similar ,"Apologies in advance, I know very little about skincare.  I’m trying to buy a gift for someone that deals with extremely dry hands.

A few years ago my wife and I were in Palm Springs.  We stopped in a store called sinfulicious and were offered a free sample of some kind of hand scrub.  They took us to these sinks in the back, and it was like a multi-step process of rinse / scrub / rinse / scrub.

For the next 2 days my hands felt softer, smoother and more moist than any human skin I’ve ever felt.  Even out there in the desert.  This stuff seemed like magic.

Unfortunately I live across the country and this store doesn’t seem to have a website or working phone number.  Does anyone have any idea what they put on our hands? Or does this sound similar to a product I could find at another store?

1712773814.0,[acne] sebaceous filaments poking out the skin,"So I have reasonably prominent sebaceous filaments on my nose. I don’t particularly mind how they look, since im the only one inspecting my face that close, but some of them are sort of poking out of my skin. It’s like they’re trying to just naturally shed out but they only get halfway. I can scrape the area very gently with a nail and they come out more but not completely (i do not do this often, i was just figuring out what was going on). Every time I go to cleanse my face or apply any step it feels gross. It’s especially bad in the corners of my nose, and does make that area look a little dry (even though it’s not). 

I’ve been focusing on hydration in that area and applying Vaseline even if I’m not slugging the rest of my face, and I do feel it helps a little but doesn’t stop it completely. I’m already oil cleansing, and I use tretinoin and azelaic acid so don’t want to (and shouldn’t need to) add any more actives to my routine.

 Does anyone have any advice? Should I just keep going with the hydration and see how it goes?

Growing up, my husbands acne, were cysts and boils under the skin on his cheeks and he would have red skin…so it wasn’t out of the ordinary for us just different because it wasn’t going away quickly. 
Anyways, I wanted to say thank you so much to everyone who responded and gave us insight. If I hadn’t asked here, We may have never went to the doctor because it isn’t too far off from his acne as a teen and just kept trying different acne products. 
We went to urgent care today and it was indeed a staph infection. I wish my post wasn’t deleted because I always lurk on reddits and when I was looking for something similar to my husbands there was nothing out there. My post with everyone’s comments could have helped the next person who deals with something similar.

1712770234.0,[acne] Suddenly getting breakouts of whiteheads around mouth?,"Around 4 weeks ago I noticed I was having a bad breakout around my chin/lips. I assumed it was hormonal so gave it a week and assumed it would clear itself up. However it hasn’t fully gone away. I was getting anywhere from 1-5 new whiteheads a day. They are small and usually burst and heal within 2/3 days before new ones appear. I have no irritation at all or rash. I stopped using the most recent cream I bought incase it was clogging my pores, and have been focusing on double cleansing the area properly. Also bought a sls free toothpaste. This all helped and I was only getting the odd spot every other day after over 2 weeks of constant spots. However I’ve woke up today with 4 new whiteheads all around my lips. I understand virtually anything could cause this but I want to stress I have NEVER had an issue with my skin like this, even as a teenager I don’t recall having breakouts this long and severe. I don’t have any sensitivities to my knowledge. Any suggestions on what I could do?

1712760739.0,[Routine Help] advise on routine after severe irritation,"I am a male. My whole life never really had a skincare routine. It pretty much consisted of just washing my face with head and shoulders during a shower. I know… not great. I have acne all over my body, but really only care about acne on face and neck/scalp. Face isn’t too bad, but I breakout on my neck and scalp pretty bad and especially is embarrassing and hurts like hell when getting a haircut every 2 weeks.

Anyways, about 2 months ago I decided to finally have a skin care routine. I did some research and ended up on the following;

Cerave Renewing SA Cleanser 
Paula’s Choice 2% BHA 
Paula’s Choice Clear Extra Strength 5% Benzoil Peroxide 
Aruba Aloe Vitamin E (As moisturizer)

I slowly added each product until I was able to incorporate all of them for a whole month straight with no adverse effects, but definitely a great improvement on the skin. The routine was:

AM 
Cerave Renewing SA Cleanser 
Aruba Aloe Viramin E

PM 
Cerave Renewing SA cleanser 
Paula’s Choice 2% BHA 
Paula’s Choice Clear 
Aruba Aloe Vitamin E

I went on vacation. The airline lost my luggage and my all my products were in there. Thankfully it was found and sent to me 4 days later. I was excited to finally be able to use my products again. I did the PM routine and went to sleep. The following morning my entire face and neck was tomato red (keep in mind I have a darker complexion) and skin was really raised and irritated. It was hot to the touch and burned anytime it was touched, or exposure to the sun. Went to the pharmacy and they said all I could do is moisturize and apply SPF. Thankfully the next day it was a lot better and eventually went through the peeling phase. About a week later I was back to normal. I can’t attribute the irritation to the products or extreme sun exposure with no protection or combination of both.

I stopped using the 2% BHA and Benzoil peroxide and I’ve been fine so far in terms of irritation. However I’m starting to break out again and I want to go back applying the products, but I want to do it right this time around. Could I get advise on a routine or advise for the following products:

Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser or SA Cleanser

 I visit a dermatologist often, and I've noticed improvements in my body acne but not so much in my hormonal acne lately. Spirono was 
 administered at 50 mg for the previous four months, and 100 mg for the most recent two. On my chin, I apply 0.025% Tretinoin from

1712753905.0,[Acne] Sugar causing acne,"Hi!! I'm 16f and I've had acne (mostly on my forehead, and a little on my chin, but never on my cheeks) to at least some degree since I was 13. I've used a few products since my skin started breaking out and although I find they work well to manage breakouts (making them scar less, and heal quicker) they never actually stop my skin from forming acne. I have very fair sensitive combination skin, and it's something that really really bothers me, so I started researching how to actually prevent acne rather than curing it, and found that acne can be very linked to your diet. I noticed during my birthday week (back in February, I had several different birthday events and they all had cakes and pastries etc.) my skin had gotten really really bad, probably the worst it had ever been. I'm not the type of person to eat a ton of sugar since I don't really have a sweet tooth, so it never occurred to me that sugar could have been the cause of my acne. I had stopped eating sugary foods (But I still ate carbs like pasta bread etc,, I just made sure nothing had any added sugar to it) and any time I wanted something sweet I would eat fruit instead. My skin improved A LOT in this period, almost instantly clearing itself, and I kept avoiding sugar. I went on holiday for a few days and since I wanted to eat local pastries, I decided it was a good idea to test my theory, just to confirm what I thought, so I ate a bunch of pastries and waited to see the results. A few days after my skin broke out really badly, confirming my suspicions. Since, I've completely avoided anything that might have sugar in it, but I wanted to know:  
  
\-Is there a way to test specifically for a sugar intolerance relating to my skin  
  
\-Is there a way to cure my intolerance / eat sugar without breaking me out  
  
\-Is this something that could pass with age,, after puberty etc

First time poster--very new to even trying to care about skincare, but I bought a skincare set that I really enjoy using in the morning and evening, but I'm just having a little trouble refining the process.

Namely, I don't really know how much time I should put between each step because the instructions online really aren't clear. I'm not sure if I should wait for my skin to dry and each product to fully absorb into my skin before moving to the next product? Also unsure if I should use my amethyst face roller at the end of every single step, at the end of just the last step of each regiment or just the morning regiment? 


Right now this is my routine and roughly how I time it:

**MORNING:**

**In shower:** CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser

**Out of shower, once face is still slightly damp:** CeraVe Vitamin C Serum, followed by the amethyst face roller (from my freezer) for a few minutes

**About 15 minutes later:** CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream

**NIGHT:**

**Before bed:** CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser

**Right away, while skin is still damp:** CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment

**At the same time:** Apply Plump-kin Retinol hydrogel eye patches

**Watch something in bed for 15-20 minutes:** Remove eye patches and put on CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream

**Sleep**

So that's my whole routine. I'm just not sure if I should put more time between each step (or just time between the steps that I kind of do in tandem--my first two morning steps and my first two night steps) and how often I should use the face roller?",SkincareAddiction

Doxycycline --> GI Issues

Hi all-- I started Doxy 2 weeks ago. I have cleared my cystic acne in the past holistically, through nutrition and hormone-balancing focused lifestyle changes, but it came back. My holistic nutritionist said that because ""acne is an injury"" and ""the body keeps score,"" one round of Doxy ought to knock it for good. 

I was apprehensive to start taking an antibiotic knowing the negative effects they play on overall GI health. I started taking a probiotic 1 week before I start Doxy to give me GI system an extra boost. 

2 weeks in, and I have never been so constipated in my life. I only saw on other Reddit posts that constipation is a rare side effect of Doxy -- well it is true and it is very unpleasant. I am drinking water, adding in extra fiber to my diet, along with taking a high quality probiotic.

I know it will subside once I am off Doxy, but wanted to let others know that it is a real symptom, albiet on the rarer side. Acne is such a struggle and so difficult to deal with every day, but I am hopeful this round of Doxy will clear it.

If not, some other ideas I had was body lotion, cleanser, or a facial hydration. A friend recommended Aesop soap, but I am uncertain of how good of a present that is.

The post important thing is the quality. I’d prefer something 100% natural. She takes good care of herself and her skin; I’d like to get something on the mid-high end side if possible. 

I am open to any and all recommendations. Brands would great too. TIA!",SkincareAddiction

1712727913.0,Super Sensitive Skin! [Routine Help]," 

Hi,
I swear it feels like l've never met anyone with skin as sensitive as mine, and I want to know if there's anyone out there who has been on the same road as me.

I'll provide a few bullet points about my skin. -Had a lot of cystic acne in my teenage years, surprisingly no acne scars. 
-Currently struggling with adult acne; larger pores/filaments along my nose and a bit of my cheek area. 
-I breakout on the apples of my cheeks, usually white heads filled with pus and regular ""red"" ones I guess.

Now, here's my skincare routine: I remove my makeup using micellar water and wash my face with warm water, then I use the Cetaphil moisturizer for dry skin.
It's alcohol free, non-comedogenic, and paraben free.

My skin tends to feel tight after I wash it, and I experience some flakiness around my nose, and no l don't use a cleanser. I tried oil cleansers as well and no luck, even la roche posay. I stuck to cream cleansers since l hear those are better for people with dry skin I'm gonna get a lot of crap for this but every cleanser I have used has broken me out, and I try to stick to it for months but it never gets better. I've used some korean brands such as COSRX, but the alcohol in it destroyed my face and made my skin feel even tighter even though it's a ""gentle cleanser"". 

Right now, I'm looking for a sunscreen for my skin, I purchased the cetaphil one since it's the only brand that had worked for me so far l; wore it yesterday and felt fine, but upon application today I felt a slight burning sensation, and by the time the evening came, I had a few whiteheads breakout along my cheeks again, and even a pimpl my ear which is so unusual and clearly points to a product causing an issue. I'm feeling kind of hopeless because everyone around me has already grown out of acne.

TLDR; I'm acne prone with dry and sensitive skin and out of the abundance of products out there, l've only found a moisturizer that doesn't break me out. I would at least like to find a sunscreen and a cleanser and I will be truly happy.

1712725227.0,[Acne] closed comodones from birth control or routine? Pls help!,"Hi,
I am 20F and white. I don’t know what to do anymore, my confidence has dropped. I used to be known as the one with porcelain doll skin but now my face is covered in tiny bumps (cc) that I can’t seem to get rid of. When I squeeze them they kinda smell weird (?) and I know they’re closed comodones bc of how deep they are (when I pop them my skin lowkey breaks). I was on “Yasmin” combo pill from January 2021 to May 2023, my skin went though a bit of a purge period but overall I was very happy with my skin. I switched to “Nextstellis” pill May 2023 to August 2023. I think I also introduced snail mucin around then. I now started “Lolo” pill January 2024 and am still on it. My skin started to become textured last summer but not really a noticeable amount to anyone. Now people are noticing, my good friend mentioned it to me the other day (with good intentions). This past school year has been stressful so that has not helped with my skin or routine because I’ve been inconsistent and changing up my products left and right. Also I know popping them is so bad but it’s addicting and I think it kinda helps..? I pop the left side of my face more and a lot of them are gone compared to the right which is completely covered in cc. I can’t think of anything else I do more on the right side of my face. Finally I’ve gone back to my normal routine which is:

AM:
Purity cleanser 
La Roche posay effaclar duo plus
Either cerave moisturizer or TO NMF + HA

PM:
Purity cleanser
TO 7% Glycolic acid
CORSX snail mucin
TO niacinimide serum
Centella green level eye cream  
Cerave night renewal cream

The main area of my cc are around my cheeks and jawline - it literally is almost every pore. My forehead is a different kind of texture, small blackheads kinda. My skin is normal, used to be oily for a second in the winter but now it stopped. I am looking for any help at all, please. I am in Ontario, Canada (& prefer budget friendly options). Pls share any tips! I appreciate it thank you!",SkincareAddiction

1712722618.0,[REVIEW] I think I may have finally found a comparable dupe for the Caudalie Vinoperfect serum.,"

(35F, Caucasian, very dry skin, not acne prone at all, redness and dryness are my biggest concerns)  

So I absolutely adore the Caudalie Vinoperfect serum - and honestly, really everything by Caudalie. But as we know, the price (in the US) is absurd. Worth it, but absurd. I’ve been searching for a “dupe” for years, because paying $82 every 2 months for a serum hurts my heart.
One of the girls at Sephora recommended to me the Eadem Milk Marvel Dark Spot Serum with Niacinamide and I’ve been using it for about 2 months now, and I think it’s as close as I’ve come!

The Eadem Milk Marvel serum is still $68, so not much cheaper, but $20 is $20. I will say that I notice the same results that I get from the Caudalie serum; my skin is brighter, much less dull, much more hydrated, less redness, less dryness. I don’t really have any dark spots or acne scaring, so I can’t attest to it’s usage for that purpose. I do have some fine lines starting to form around my eyes/11’s, but they’re not too severe, and I use so many products that I’m not sure what is contributing to lessen the fine lines, but the Eadem serum may be helping with that as well.  

I figured I would provide my experience since I see so many posts looking for a dupe for the Caudalie.",SkincareAddiction

1712721518.0,"[Routine Help] Moisturizer/Product Recs for Oily, Dehydrated, Sensitive Skin","Mostly as the title says. A lot of moisturizers are too heavy feeling for my skin. Using a thin layer will feel nice for maybe ten minutes and then my skin will feel incredibly dry after it's absorbed, but using a thicker layer or adding more after my skin feels dry results in a greasy feeling to my skin and then I break out. 

I've heard gel moisturizers are better for oily skin, but when I tried one I saw recommended often (Neutrogena HydroBoost) it worked perfect for a few weeks and then it just... stopped moisturizing. It kind of felt like putting aloe vera on a sunburn where it feels cooling for a bit and then a few moments later it just burns again.

I'm probably going to keep using the Curology prescription service but all the basic products I'll need to swap out for cheapo drugstore stuff. I used Cerave in high school but I see people saying all sorts of bad things about it now which makes me anxious.

My skin is primarily dry; I do get minor breakouts but my skin never really feels oily. I can't say 100% but I believe I have mild rosacea. I'm 31 and have some mild forehead lines that were the anxiety tipping point that made me want to start doing this in the first place. My skin tends to be picky and react weirdly to things though this is a worse problem on my body than my face (chronic urticaria + extensive KP). 

Current routine:

AM: 

- No cleanser unless I sweat a particularly large amount the night before (or I fell asleep without washing the night before lol). Wash with water or use Quench Micro Water Complex Foaming Cleanser if needed

- If my face is feeling angry, Thayers Rose Petal Facial Mist. I've heard people disparage this stuff but it's literally the one non-prescription thing I have that I like. Feels like the moisturizer gets absorbed way better if I use this first and it makes my face feel super soft all by itself.

- Moisturizer: currently working through my tiny tube of Curology Cream Moisturizer which I like a lot but it's insanely expensive and I'm almost out after less than 2 weeks. After that runs out, I have Quench Micro Water Daily Glow Moisturizer.

- No sunscreen! Yes, I will change this lol 

PM (alternating days):

Day A:

- Cleanse w/ Quench Micro Water Complex Foaming Cleanser

- Moisturizer (Curology again, when that runs out Quench Micro Water Complex Night Relief Creme) 

- Wait 20 minutes, then apply a small amount of my Curology custom formula (tret, clindamycin phosphate, azelaic acid) along with some of my AM moisturizer

I honestly felt like he just wanted me in and out, it was all very quick. I genuinely have no idea if this is just how derm visits are or what. I also don't know if all the bp will be drying to my skin.

Haven't been the best about keeping sunscreen on my face in my early 20s but have gotten better about it over the past year.

I just wanted you guys opinion on this because for the past 2-3 months l've noticed these lines they have really been bothering me.

Coming here because my latest dermatologist took a skin sample and diagnosed me with folliculitis after a lifetime of not knowing. But the treatment he prescribed didn't work. I've been on medication before and that helped but it caused my potassium levels to skyrocket. I tried acutane but my triglyceride count TRIPLED (apparently a side effect) and my dermatologist nearly triggered my eating disorder by demanding I cut ALL fats from my diet for the duration of treatment. 

I'm at my wits end. My skin has always scarred easily but the bumps, acne, clogged follicles, whatever, are constantly breaking out all over my back, neck, chest, shoulders, and upper arms. Now it's spread to my legs and started leaving scars. My ND stim is skin picking, but when my skin is clear I have no issues. I use Cln products (dermatologist recommended) but don't use body lotion because it makes me break out in white heads and pimples.

CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser, Moisturising Lotion and Hyaluronic Serum.

I started every two days when showering, now doing it daily as my skin has no irritation with SA. I stopped using the serum last week as the moisturizer has hyaluronic acid in it but now I feel my nose is visibly very oily at the end of the day. I'm probably only putting the cleanser on for 1-2 minutes.

I've been doing that for about a month and recently bought Clinique Take The Day off. Similar to the SA, I'm only leaving that on for about 1-2 minutes and rinsing with water. I do this at night before bed.

I know SA takes time, I think there is a slight improvement but photos almost look the same, it looks a bit better in person. It's as if they have gone from big, black dots to slightly smaller, almost grey looking. With the oil cleanser I feel like there's immediate improvement when it's done but looking in the mirror the following day it looks like it's back to normal. I wonder am I better off cleansing in the morning? Is once a night not enough? Should I leave each cleanser on for X amount of minutes?

Given the delicate balance of our skin's microbiome, I'm curious about the impact of various skincare products and routines. From cleansers and moisturizers to exfoliants and serums, every product we apply has the potential to disrupt or support this microbial community.

So I am 17 years old about to turn 18. I’ve been back and forth with acne about 2 years I wanna say now. My start of my junior year I started breaking out like crazy which was suprising because I had never had acne before. I eventually went to a dermatologist because it got decent then came back even worse. I didn’t know what I was doing. Eventually I got prescribed, doxycycline to take once every day, tretinoin .05%, and a clindamycin lotion to use. I used that for about 3-4 months and my skin cleared up really good. I ended up getting about 3 sessions of microneedling done and my skin was looking great. I wasn’t getting anymore pimples and if I was they were really small and would go away fast. So I went the whole summer with clear and good skin until I got to the start of my senior year. I ended up getting hands foot and mouth disease from a teammate of mine. It all went away but after that I would say maybe 2 weeks after that I got one big nodule that I think just started it all back up again. I went back to the dermatologist and got prescribed the same stuff again. I wanna say this time it came back worse. I went through the whole 3-4 month process again with these pills. Everything cleared up but I would still have pimples that were deeper than last time pop out and it was concerning but I just kept doing what I was doing because they came and went really fast. Eventually I got back to microneedling because from the pills they left prettt bad scars that would make my face appear more red and looked like I had pimples when I didn’t so that was one of my first things to try and get done . I told my derma about the breakouts I would have so they upped my dosage of tretinoin to .1% and the gel version of clindyamycin. This is where I started to get more pimples. It’s been about week and a half since my last microneedling session where they also prescribed me my new stuff. Since I would use the Clindymaycin lotion as my lotion in the morning I have had troubles finding a lotion that doesn’t make my skin red. I used the vanicream daily facial moisturizer and the ceraave pm which I noticed made my face more red. Just last night I used the la rose posay triple repair cream which didnt make my face as red as the others. Right now I’m pretty  discouraged as face isn’t as bed as it was but it’s still breaking out  and it’s noticeable. I try to get a gallon of water in everyday which I’m. Prett good at doing. I also try to eat prettt clean. Idk what to do should I wait it out see how my skin does till my next microneedling session.

Paula’s Choice’s ingredient dictionary hasn’t rated these ingredients yet and I’m unsure if they’re just fragrance components or if they have actual benefits. When searching, I see hibiscus is an antioxidant? 

People are also saying the moisturizer itself has a slight fragrance. 

I usually don’t use products with fragrance in the chance it could be irritating, but I’m unsure about this product.

1712635190.0,[routine help] Did I do this right!? Embarking on routine journey for the first time.,"I am 39f and have never really had a skincare routine in my life besides rubbing my face with plain water in the shower, throwing on whatever moisturizer is at hand in the mornings, and occasional sunscreen. I have not really had any skin issues besides dryness and anxiety-induced skin picking.

I have started to notice some dark spots and uneven skin tone as well as larger pores and some dry spots/flaking (esp where i have picked) I don’t know if it’s aging, the skin picking, the sun or dehydration.

I made some quick purchases that claim to tackle my current concerns:

1. Moisturizing
2. Dark spots/uneven skin tone
3. Minimizing pores 
4. Anti - aging/ wrinkle prevention (I’m hitting 40)
5. SPF protection.

How did I do with the products I have chosen below?? Please help me with my starter routine— is it a good product? Is there a better alternative? Is there a step I missed in the routine? Any must-have ingredients I should incorporate ?

I did not purchase any luxury products since I  am just starting this journey. The options are overwhelming and I was scared to splurge on things I just don’t understand. But here are the products:

Cleanser : Cerave Hydrating Cream to foam cleanser (for the ceramides, hyaloronic acid, and amino acids.

Toner: Bliss Disappearing Act Niacinamide + Pore Vanish Toner ( for pore minimizing, green tea and mushroom extract)

Treatment: Curology Dark Spot Serum (niacinamide, glycolic acid, tranexamic acid, kojic acid and licorice root extract.

Moisturizer: Remedial Pax Day and Night Retinol and Collagen Moisturizer Face Cream (viral on tik tok, retinol for wrinkles, collagen, hyaloronic acid 5%)

SPF: AHC Natural Perfection Fresh Sun Stick (spf 50 and PA++++…whatever that is)

Any insight from those of you with much more experience than me is highly appreciated.

I seem to be missing vitamin C and peptides from this routine, which seem like generally recommend ingredients. Not sure if I can skip them or replace a product above with one that incorporates them.",SkincareAddiction
1712683117.0,How’s my routine? [Routine help],"These are all of the skincare products I have, I only listed the ingredients that stand out based on my very limited skincare knowledge.

Aquaphor (41% petrolatum)

CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser (salicylic acid, glycerin, niacinimide, NP ceramide, hyaluronic acid, vitamin D)

Vaseline cocoaglow Intensive Care Moisturizer (Petrolatum, glycerin)
L’Oreal Revitalift (10% glycolic acid)

Niacinimide bubble things
Hyaluronic acid bubble things

Normally, I’ll wash my face with either CeraVe cleanser (depending on how oily my skin is) and use a niacinimide bubble and a hyaluronic acid bubble at night and leave my face alone in the morning.

1712679864.0,"[Misc] Battle of the tatcha dupes!  Purito, Indeed Labs and Brandefy.  Help me choose!","I have my eye on the tatcha “the essence.”  It is comprised ~98% of fermented rice, fermented green tea and fermented algae.  This checks a lot of boxes for me as I always need a green tea toner in my routine for red light therapy and sake is allegedly good for hyperpigmentation, which I have.  However it’s soooo expensive and reviews have convinced me it’s not worth all that money.

The purito 94 fermentation essence has 94% of fermented rice and fermented green tea.  No fermented algae but it has a TON of other goodies instead - botanicals and plant extracts that are nice to have.  Also it’s ~$11 for 5 ounces.  Tatcha costs 10x that amount!

The indeed labs microbiome essence has fermented rice and fermented green tea, albeit in unspecified concentrations.  It also has a bunch of fermented mushroom ingredients which are allegedly good for hyperpigmentation, as well as a ton of other goodies such as amino acids (which I love).  It is $25 for 3 ounces.  More expensive than the purito but still a fraction of the cost of the tatcha.

Brandefy does not have a dupe of this essence but I wanted to include them so anyone who reads this post knows that they have a dupe of the tatcha water cream!

Can anyone help me choose?  I’m leaning toward purito because it’s cheaper and states the concentration of fermented actives, which I like.  But I can definitely be convinced to go with the indeed labs!

1712652126.0,[Routine Help] Seeking Advice for My Skincare Routine. Help me to evaluate it.,"Hello everyone,

---- Background ----

I've been a silent observer, lurking on this sub for quite some time now. Today I've finally posted to seek your help in evaluating my current skincare routine.

Some background information: I'm a 22-year-old male who has been grappling with moderate to severe acne for about a decade, spanning most of my teenage years. My struggles have included phases of cystic acne, blackheads, and inflamed red skin.

Despite the challenges, I've opted for lighter solutions rather than stronger medications like Accutane. Currently, I'd say my skin has improved overall and my acne has highly diminished, though my skin tends to be oily and slightly sensitive.

I still have to deal with occasional acne, red spots, blackheads, as well as noticeable sebaceous filaments and acne scars on my cheeks.

--- The Routine ----

I've attempted to develop a logical skincare routine, incorporating the basics recommended by this reddit community (The Sca routine)  along with active products that have suited me during trial runs.

In my country (not the U.S), obtaining an appointment with a dermatologist is very challenging, with wait times ranging from six months to a year.

Thus, in the meantime, I've taken it upon myself to educate myself through online resources like this sub and have also obtained some prescribed medications from my general doctor.

I've created this skincare routine that I have been following for a couple of months now with good results when I have been consistent with it. No big acne flare ups or irritation.

I'll soon be incorporating Benzoyl peroxide and Doxycycline into my routine, in addition to my basic regimen.

I've added the BP to my routine builder (in the picture), it might me important to you to precise that it is 5% concentration and also leave on. I live in Europe If that's also of any importance.

Here is an overview of my current routine. I would greatly appreciate any feedback and advice you may have. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

I’m a real rusher in general and anything extra that I have to do always ends up pissing me off. I decided to start some skincare stuff back in January as I got some great gifts for Christmas and I’ve been worrying about wrinkles etc. I’ve been doing it since then, so I’m now using toner, spf, retinol, and some other serums and stuff but a couple of those have run out and I’ve decided I’m going to keep it simple whilst still using spf and retinol and the basics such as cleanser and moisturiser. But anyway, my point I’m getting to is; I hate doing it. Before now I just used to cleanse and moisturise and even then I’d be slapping that moisture on to get it over with. The last week I’ve dropped back to my old ways and last night all I did was my old cleanse and moisturise.

1712647845.0,[Product request] I over moisturized the skin under my nose!! Do I use anything to help it?,"I was sick last week and had irritated skin under my nose from blowing my nose and wiping it. I opted to put aquaphor on it like allll day for like 5 days 😐

In hindsight this was so stupid to do, but the irritated skin was just so itchy and annoying that aquaphor got rid of that pretty quick

Now the skin is very tight and feels hot/still itchy because the skin is so tight and its right above my lips so speaking/talking stretches the skin out

Putting water on it fixes it but obviously for like 2 seconds. So I figured I over moisturized the hell out of the skin in that specific spot

This is a bit of a long post & it’s also extremely embarrassing for me but oh well, I need the help. Before October 2023, my skin had always been perfect& blemish free. I’d get the occasional hormonal or period-induced pimples but they would go away on their own after a few days. It’s also important to note that I had never really consistently used any skincare products aside from sunscreen & and moisturizer. This was up until about October 2023 when I started using a concealer that I guess I was unknowingly sensitive to which  caused me to break out BADLY. I would wake up to whiteheads and pustules every day after using it the day before and I was very annoyed because I wasn’t used to this. I then started picking away at these pimples and this resulted in dark spots. I was looking for a quick fix and someone recommended the salicylic acid wash from Cerave and I went ahead and got it and started using it EVERYDAY , in the AM and the PM !!! (very foolish to say the least). I guess I damaged my skin barrier and I started breaking out even more, especially on my cheeks and forehead and everytime these pimples went away or I picked at them, they left EXTREMELY dark spots. On top of that, around November or December I developed what I think is cystic acne  and it triggered my dermatillomania and I started poking holes in the bumps with a razor to be able to squeeze the goo out. If I was not picking away at those bumps and pustules, I was picking away at the scabs that were left behind. It’s been 5 months since the breakout that ruined my life happened but my skin just keeps getting worse and worse (because of my inability to stop picking at my skin and maybe the products I use idfk). I’ve introduced and removed so many products to my routine but nothing works. I’ve changed my diet a trillion times and still NOTHING works. My skin is ruined and it’s all my fault. I can’t step out without makeup now lol.This may seem dramatic to some but I have genuinely come very close to killing myself over my skin. I’m beyond depressed, I’ve completely isolated myself from friends and regularly skip classes if I’m having a particularly horrible skin day, which has ruined a few grades this semester. There’s currently a huge shortage of dermatologists where I live and the waitlists are genuinely crazy.. like 8 months-2 years, so I can’t even go see a professional. Has anyone else ever had skin this horrible and would you be able to recommend a course of action or products that helped? Here’s what I currently use on& off

AM:
- dove bar soap or just water
- la roche posay ultra fluid spf 50+ 
- glossier priming moisturizer balance
- la roche posay acne treatment 

PM:
- sephora makeup wipes
- dove bar soap or salicylic acid wash
- topicals faded serum (3-4 times a week)
- cerave moisturizing cream
- snail mucin
- la roche posay acne treatment 
- laneige cica sleeping mask
- divine essence carrot oil extract (idk someone told me to use this) 
 
Since I have never really had to worry about my skin type and skincare products, I’m unsure what ingredients to look for and which ones to avoid because Idk what ingredients in the concealer even made me break out in the first place. I’m just really desperate tbh lol all and any advice is appreciated thanks :(",SkincareAddiction

I recently asked my friend to give me some skincare products since i wanna fix my face and so i want to know if these 4 products are good and if im going them in the right order.

So i first wash my face and dry it with a towel and then i use an oil cleanser on my face for like a minute and then i add a little bit of water on my hands to kinda activate the product i think (according to tiktoks they say its mandatory) after this i wash it off with warm water and pat my face dry. And the product i use for this is “ANUA pore control cleansing oil” 

After i do that i use “ANUA pore deep cleansing foam” for another minute and before i put it on my face i make sure to rub it so it looks foamy. After this i wash my fave with warm water and pat dry it once more.

After this i use the “watermelon glow pore tight toner” from glow recipe and spread it on my face. After that i use the “strawberry smooth clarifying and retexturing pore minimizer and hidrating face serum.


Now i think im using the last 2 products in the wrong order but i dont know if i am so im asking yall if its good or not. Please tell me if i should do something different or if im doing something wrong",SkincareAddiction

(I stopped using it because it was making me turn crimson red when I used my moisturizer) I still haven't used it but my acne got worse today and I'm not sure if it was due to me not using retinol, or due to me just having a breakout.

1712641789.0,[Routine Help] My skincare routine: good or too much?,"I'm 25F- turning 26, normal skin and not prone to breakout/acne. I have these little bumps on T-zone (assuming they are clogged pores or whiteheads) since I was 10. Used to do a lot of exercise when I was younger so I'm guessing it's from all the sweating. I'm a sweaty person in general. And now I'm noticing there's MORE of those tiny bumps under my eyeglasses's rubber nosepad.

I purchased my skincare based on moods and the urge to try new products (I know..) so they may or may not go well with each other. However, my skin isn't very picky so I haven't picked up any changes or abnormality.

Currently my skincare routine goes like this by steps. Note I only do my routine at night.

1. Cleanser: Corsx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser
2. Essence: Corsx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence
3. Serum: IUnik Propolis Vitamin Synergy Serum
4. The Retinol 0.1 Cream (Just bought and introduced this to my face last night: 1 time usage up to date!)
5. Cream: HADA LABO Premium Hydrating Cream

What do you think of this skincare routine?

Thinking of getting COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid to use as treatment for these bumps. If I were to introduce this to my routine, I'm thinking of rotating the retinol and this power liquid every other day. Would this liquid go well with the cleanser as they both contain salicylic acid?",SkincareAddiction

1712634408.0,[Routine Help] Keratosis Pilaris,"I started actively treating my KP recently with chemical exfoliants, but it’s worse than ever now!! I’ve tried the Peach slices salicylic acid toner for 3wks which just increased the amount of bumps and redness to no end. Then I switched to glycolic acid which would calm it down sometimes but my KP would still flare up with bumps. 

The reason why I think it has to be these exfoliants is because the KP has since spread to the areas where I put the exfoliants. I should also mention that I use the Naturium salicylic acid body wash, but nothing works :(

1712632502.0,[misc] why can't i use salicylic acid or sulfur with differin?,"so this is something i'm really confused about, you can use benzoyl peroxide with differin, but not salicylic acid or sulfur? 
and i'm not talking about layering these products, or even using them on the same day, just using them in your routine at the same time. 
from what i understand, it's because those ingredients are potentially irritating and drying and so is differin so they shouldn't be used together, but BP is also irritating and drying so?? and sulfur specifically is considered way more gentle than BP or SA. 
it's frustrating, because i've never tried BP, and my skin really likes SA and sulfur.

1712626155.0,PSA: be careful with hyaluronic acid !!! [PSA],"(None of this is medical advice, I am not a doctor, this is just my personal experience and I wish I saw this when I was on this subreddit. Please talk to ur doctor before doing anything with your skin :))

Hey guys! I used to be one of those people with mild acne and no skincare routine, so I decided to start a skincare routine to fix it. That was quite literally the worst mistake ever. 

I tried tretinoin for 6 months, and it turned my mild acne into severe. My skin also got extremely dry, so I was compensating with hylaluronic acid (HA). Nothing was working, so I cut out the tretinoin. After 3 months off the tret, my skin was getting dryer and dryer. So, I cut out all active ingredients except for HA, yet my skin was just getting worse. 

Finally, I found a tik tok that said that for some people, using HA can dry out the skin and make acne worse. Therefore, I stopped using HA, and immediately my skin got 70% better. Rarely any more new pimples, and my skin has stopped being dry. This was a month ago and my skin has stayed better. 

Is my skin completely clear ? Nope. Am I still going on accutane to cure it once and for all? Yes. But I think I could’ve avoided all of this if I didn’t ruin my skin barrier so long with tret and HA. So if you have incorporated those, and your skin is freaking out for more than 4-6 weeks, consider speaking with ur dermatologist and stopping before it’s too late and you have to go on accutane like me lol.

I have finally found a routine that works well, it’s very simple but I’ve found what works best for me. I’ve always had very oily skin but now I know that it was producing excess oil because it was too dry! 

AM:
• rinse with water
• moisturize with Björns Royal Jelly Face Cream
• apply sunscreen, I use Björns 30 SPF mineral sunscreen 

PM:
• rinse with water
• oil cleanse with rose hip oil 
• Björns face cream 

If I’m breaking out I use African Black soap, but using that every day dries out my skin too much. Occasionally i will use the Aztec Indian Healing Clay mask and I also use pimple patches for small breakouts. After a workout I drink Vital Proteins collagen powder. I hope anyone who sees this and relates to the first picture knows that there is light at the end of the tunnel!! I never thought my skin could get to where it is today.

1712598022.0,[Product Question] Using a Niacinamide/Lactic Acid Serum with Azelaic Acid?,"Can a Niacinamide/Lactic Acid serum be used while using Azelaic Acid 15%? If so, where would it go in a routine?

For context, I used to be on Spironolactone, Tazarotene cream, First Aid Beauty's Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration for AM, Cerave PM Moisturizer for PM, and La Roche Posay's Vitamin C serum. When I voiced to my dermatologist about plans to start a family, she had me stop ALL of those products. The prescriptions and the Vitamin C serum (it has salicylic acid), I understand. But I don't understand why I needed to stop the FAB and Cerave PM moisturizers. Regardless, I weaned myself off of them gradually, but now that I am pregnant and no longer on those products, I am TERRIBLY broken out, my skintone is uneven, and my pores are larger and are appearing more on my cheeks, not just the usual problem area being my nose.

I am currently just cleansing with Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleaner and following it with either Neutrogena Hydroboost in the AM, and Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion in the PM. My dermatologist just prescribed Azelaic Acid 15%, so I started using it every other night after my moisturizer to try to get my skin adjusted to it. I was eyeing [Sephora's Niacinamide/Lactic Acid serum](https://www.sephora.com/product/gentle-peeling-serum-P509318?skuId=2693448&icid2=products%20grid:p509318:product), because it is pregnancy safe and seems it could help with my skin concerns. Is it redundant to use that if I am using Azelaic Acid, or does it address concerns that Azelaic does not cover? Would it just be used daily prior to moisturizer in the morning?

Also, any other pregnancy-safe products would be greatly appreciated!",SkincareAddiction
1712597727.0,[Personal] I'm so frustrated with contradicting reviews and lack of trustworthy research.,"Hi all,

This is just a rant. I've been trying to set myself up with a routine for three years now. It has been so frustrating. I'm 27, have PIE, uneven skin tone and a couple of wrinkles and I've been on a tight budget. I have tried retinol, vitamin C, AHA, alpha arbutin, and azleic acid in addition to my usual sunscreen, moisturizer and cleanser. I have never seen results. Each time I start a routine, I keep going for 2-3 months and then come across something online that tells me I'm doing it wrong. Then, I get disappointed and give up for a while. The latest one was reading about product degradation. sounds like I should throw away everything I have and buy a whole new set of products. So, again I'll go into the rabbit hole of the internet telling me everything is bad and nothing will work. Also, an influencer derm said I shouldn't have been putting retinol on my smile lines. So, what the hell am I supposed to do for those wrinkles? This is so frustrating. I wish there was a single OTC product (not ingredient) that was super well-researched by unbiased parties that I could just stick to.

Anyway, thanks for reading my rant. Any tips or encouragements are welcome.",SkincareAddiction

Another thing is that my skin texture never ever really changes, no matter what i use. I'm on tret, i've been before, this problem is here since forever, i've tried peels, barrier repairing, everything. Texture isn't a problem actually anymore for me, i just wonder why my skin looks so bad during the day, and after i wash my face in the evening it looks great again (only to flare up a couple of hours later, especially if i moisturise).

I wash my hands ""A lot"" (Dove original because its ""mild""), before eating, after eating, after cleaning, after using the bathroom, after coming from the work/street, for me its normal hygiene. I wash dishes with gloves.

After washing my hands, I dry them with a towel and after a few minutes I moisture them with CeraVe (Moisturising lotion / the blue one), this prevented the hangnails from appearing but didn't solved the redness or swelling at all.

Sometimes my nails split, always on the sides, like ""hangnail effect"" but instead of skin they are nail fragments

Today, I went to a demartologist and she basically said my skincare routine was way too much and irritating for my skin.

I was surprised as I specifically chose stuff that weren’t irritating. I stopped the pill two months ago so I bought a new routine to prevent acne and it worked relatively well except for hormonal acne.  

Here is my skincare and what she told me to stop : 

- Double cleansing with oil (Beauty of Joseon) and then, water-based cleanser (Abib acne foam). She told me to stop the oil.
- Soothing heartleaf toner > told me to stop it.
- Nail mucin essence > told me to stop it.
- Pink serum for skin barrier, the ordinary > told me to stop it and use a zinc + niacinamide serum. 
- Centella asiatica probio-cica cream > ok.

Hi! I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but it also felt out of place on [](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/), so I'm rolling the dice.

I got Ipsy bags from 2015 to about 2017. During that time, I once got a hand lotion sample in my Ipsy bag that was lemon-scented. The graphic design of the lotion tube was similar to the J.R. Watkins lemon hand cream, but had a bit more 'flair' as I would call it, more black curly line accents and flowers. The tube itself resembled a paint tube, with the cap being skinny at the base and the top of the cap being a wide flat disk.

The hand cream itself smells just like if Girl Scout Lemonaids cookies and a bakery had a baby. Whenever I had the lotion on, people would come to my office and comment how delicious and incredible it smelled in there. It was sort of thicker in viscosity, and it never left an unpleasant oily feeling on my hands.

Ive been using them for a couple of weeks now and can't see any results. My mum wants me to stick with them a bit longer and wait and see, and I also know little of something called purging, so i'm not sure. Cause if things cant turn around id rather switch back before my skin gets any worse. 

I really don't know much about these stuff, so advice would be very appreciated. Thanks.",SkincareAddiction
1712572810.0,[Routine Help] Tret routine help pls,"Am I missing anything here? (Tret routine)

So my current routine is as follows

AM:
Cleanse - Cerave Gentle Cleanser
Vitamin C Serum
Toner followed by Snail Mucin
Moisturiser
SPF

PM:
Oil cleanse
Water based cleanse
Snail Mucin and wait till dry
Tretinoin and wait to dry
Moisturiser

Tret is every other day 0.025% strength. On tret off days the PM routine is just water cleanse, the ordinary buffet, snail mucin then moisturise 

Atm I have some congestion in the forehead that seems to be coming to the surface. It goes from being smooth to then bumpy so I'm unsure whether that's the tret causing that or something else? Is there anything else that would be worth adding?

1712571055.0,[Personal] tip for everyone don't make my mistake. DO NOT DO SKINCARE AFTER EATING CHILLI,"Should be pretty obvious but I'm dumb enough and did this. I love my hot sauce so I spiced up my soft tacos with Carolina reaper sauce and obviously after eating it's still active and is on my lips and hands. I then proceeded to clean my hands and mouth as you do after super hot food and then did my skincare. The issue is the chilli was still there and during skincare you skin is super sensitive

I exfoliated which my exfoliant has a a little bit of a tingle so I ignored as that's normal for exfoliant. Kept going with niacamide,zinc and moisturiser than the next bad part... I put adapelene gel on. Exfoliant plus adapelene caused a chemical reaction with the chili and iafter a few minutes I started turning red and burning like crazy causing me to freak out cleanse everything off and wash my face put cold clothes on my cheeks and a load of moisturiser and aloe vera. It's still burning a bit and I'm putting aloe vera on as I go but please don't make my mistake 😭. 

Always wait a few hours so the chilli stops being as harsh and wash and double wash your hands and mouth until it's got no chance of spreading chilli on your face. 

If anyone's done this before and has any tips other than aloe vera and milk it would be greatly appreciated...",SkincareAddiction

Doing my night time routine first means that the product I apply may get washed away. However, showering first is bad for the skin, right?

 I’ve thought about doing the routine in two sections : remove makeup and maybe double cleanse before showering, then continue after but I’m just worried that my skin will feel dry during the shower, especially since it will be steamy.

Applying moisturiser before the shower seems a bit pointless since it’ll need to be washed away…  What are your thoughts on this or what is your routine like for this type of encounter? ",SkincareAddiction

I decided to share my own experience. I wasn't sure of the cause—whether it was external or internal—or if it could be resolved at all. Small, dark, patchy spots began appearing on my stomach area, spreading daily. Part of me thought it might be skin cancer.

To address the issue, I took several steps:
- I rewashed all my towels and bed sheets.
- I discontinued use of my new body wash (Olay), as I noticed the spots began appearing around the time I started using it.
- I applied an antibacterial spray (hydrochlorous acid, to be specific) to my stomach area daily.
- I used an African net and a sugar body scrub to exfoliate the dark patches.

After a month, the issue was resolved, and the marks disappeared completely. I strongly believe the body wash was the culprit, causing an allergic reaction.

It's been 2 days since I started and I'm really worried that I'll start purging. I've only used the Winlevi so far and only once a day because I'd like to introduce all this slowly. I was hoping to get some advice of what, if any, of the following products I already own might help in dealing with the pending purge. I also would really appreciate any feedback on what order I should use products since I'm very new to this.

1. Cosrx snail mucin
2. CeraVe AM moisturizer (SPF 30)
3. CeraVe PM moisturizer
4. CeraVe foaming cleanser
5. Clinique ultra hydrating moisturizer
6. Kiehls ultra facial cleanser
7. Kiehls Rare Earth deep pore cleansing mask
8. Kiehls invisible acne liquid pimple patch
9. Sephora vitamin C serum
10. Pimple patches
11. Aztec secretIndian healing clay mask

1712534584.0,[Acne] Can I just be on like... A little birth control? ,"Tl;dr HRT for acne? 

Wondering if this is possible or something worth asking my derm about.

Basically, my skin has no acne on birth control. I used Yaz then Annovera. I wouldn't say it was great though because my skin was also horribly dry and would peel if I wore any makeup which was not the worst thing since my skin was pretty clear. However my libido was pretty low. 

Went off birth control and the acne came back (like I have an acne beard basically, total pizza face) and my skin is less dry, but still prone to peeling if I'm not very careful with what I use. So I have the acne and covering it is often super hard. But I don't want my libido to go away. I like sex, so it was like really enjoying cheesecake but never being in the mood for cheesecake. :(

I've had one appointment with a derm so far, and she prescribed spironolactone and tret. She was really excited about me starting spiro since she said I was a great candidate. However... Spiro gave me afib 😭 which sucked because I was really hopeful about it but I can't be messing around with my heart. I'd been on tret before (for several years... Like purging should have been long over) and it hasn't really done anything except make my skin really irritated even when doing all the techniques to reduce irritation (it was a Curology formula tho, so maybe one of the other actives was actually the problem, but Differin also does this to me).

But I KNOW the birth control worked and it didn't have any really concerning side effects (like the afib). Yaz and Annovera have ethynil estradiol in common. Idk if that's what's used when MTF people start HRT, but can I like... Go on a little ethynil estradiol/some other hormone? Because I don't need it to work as birth control, I just need enough to get my skin to settle down. I'm just wondering if that's a thing. 🤔 Thanks ya'll! ",SkincareAddiction
1712533586.0,[Misc] My derm told me something that seems really weird...,"Before I say what it is, here is my routine in a simplified way:

AM - Cleanse, sunscreen  
PM - Cleanse, moisturize, hydroquinone 40mg/g + tretinoin 0.5mg/g + fluocinolone acetonide 0.1mg/g (3x week), adapalene 3mg + benzoyl peroxide 25mg (2x week)

The issue came when I told her I go to the gym in the AM and, since I have oily, acne prone skin, with a lot of redness (post-inflammatory erythema that gets even redder after working out), she said I should stick with the same routine and didn't need to cleanse after the gym, therefore, keep doing it before working out, and also not for a third time besides the first in the morning (which seemed like too much, but still).

Isn't this weird? Considering my situation, wouldn't it be just better if I removed the sweat after? She seems smart and well-studied but this made me feel a bit insecure about what to do.

1712533076.0,[Product Question] Can I mix Cerave AM and PM to make a better formula?,"Hey everyone. I’m a huge fan of CeraVe’s PM moisturizer and Moisturizing Lotion. I also enjoy using the AM moisturizer in the daytime, as i have dry skin and am also a pale redhead, and find sunscreen moisturizers to be convenient and protective. The only problem with the AM moisturizer is that i cannot apply it alone without it pilling on my face. To avoid this, I will pump about 2 pumps of PM moisturizer on then back of my hand, and then about 2-3 pumps of the AM, mix them together (think ""skincare smoothie"") and then i find it applies much smoother. I have been thinking about simply just mixing a bunch of the PM moisturizer into the AM jar.

Will combining products like that bugger up the sun- protectiveness of the AM moisturizer?

If it's not a good idea, what are some of yalls recommendations for good affordable sunscreen moisturizers? I break out easily (any oil containing product will cause breakouts), have quite dry skin, and am a 21 year old female.

It also feels like everything always sits on top of my skin and the same areas that were dry a few days ago are still scaly. Its as if moisturizing only makes the scales softer they don’t ever go away. idek if im explaining correctly but idk what to do. im scared to exfoliate because maybe my barrier is still broken but then this could also just be dead skin. how do u figure out if i need more hydration or if i need exfoliating?",SkincareAddiction

Since month 3 after stopping the pill, it’s been getting worse and worse. It peaks before my period (horrible cystic acne) and then gets slightly better, but even now a week after my period I’m getting new whiteheads, the cystic acne has got a bit better but generally my skin texture is awful, so many small pimples and redness etc.

I had isotretinoin (Roaccutane) as a teenager as struggled with teenage acne which worked well and I didn’t have any acne between stopping that and starting on birth control a few years later.

My current routine: AM - Dermalogica precleanse, Dermalogica active cleanser, Dermalogica age bright clearing serum, Dermalogica active moist moisturiser, SPF50. PM -  the same as above but I also use Dermalogica microfoliant after cleansing and don’t use SPF.

I have been using blemish patches on new spots to try and make them heal better.

I initiated the Dermalogica routine a few weeks ago after my usual Elemis routine wasn’t cutting it anymore as my skin has definitely become more oily since stopping the pill.

1712486734.0,Skin worse after skincare [Acne] [Routine Help],"Hi everyone I'm a 16M that has been using korean skincare since december 2023. My skin used to be dry and I had a flaky patch above my lips and under my nose. My cheeks were relatively clear and I had closed comedones on my forehead. Now, after using korean skincare, my skin is definitely worse. I had red bumps on my cheeks which I'm not sure if its acne or dark spots. 

I'm not sure if my skin is sensitive as sometimes after doing my skincare I can feel some stinginess and burning but sometimes I don't feel it. 

PM:

* Skin1004 oil cleanser
* Dokdo cleanser 
* Sometimes isntree aha 8 clear essence
* Roundlab dokdo toner or cosrx propolis
* Skin1004 centella ampoule
* Sometimes isntree hylarounic serum
* Roundlab dokdo lotion or sometimes soonjung 2x barrier cream 

AM:

* Water
* Roundlab toner
* Skin1004 ampoule
* isntree hyla serum
* Soonjung 2x barrier cream
* Skin1004 sunscreen 

I currently have the: ksecret snail mucin, anua toner, dr althea vitamin c serum and purito deep sea cream that I will most likely start using after I receive them. However, I won't use all of them. I will definitely use the anua toner and purito deep sea cream to replace my soon jung cream and round lab toner. 

Is there any probable reason for my skin worsening after skincare?",SkincareAddiction

1712481671.0,[PSA] Skincare brand scamming customers ,"I came across a brand called Alpha Serum. They sell luxury serums that cost over $200, and theyre being resold for 90% off at clearance retailers like tkmaxx. I've done some digging and it looks like this is one of those brands that are deliberately, unreasonably overpriced - not because of quality, but so that they can resell to heavily discounted stores like tk max. In other words, it's a scam. Their website was created in September 2019. The owner, Franck Daligand, has ""A thorough understanding of big businesses and brands and how they work. Proven experience in developing traditional and digital marketing strategies.
Thrives on big challenges and on turning new products and services into dependable sources of profit."" - this is from his LinkedIn profile. He knows how to market a cheap serum, crease false price brackets and then trick consumers into thinking they're buying luxury products at retail price. 

He has another ""luxury"" skincare brand called KAVIAAR KARE. A caviar and hyaluronic acid moisturiser with no studies to back up his claims. The product has a 3.9/5 star rating based on over 100 reviews. That rating alone is worse that the cheapest brands in the UK.

1712474679.0,[routine help] What step to add gua sha!?,"
Hello!! 

I’ve been developing an evening skincare routine for some time and I landed on one I like. But now that I want to add gua sha to the routine, I’m not sure I’ve done so in the best way… but maybe I have! You tell me:

1. Paula’s Choice Foaming Cleanser
2. Paula’s Choice Toner (been trying a few different ones) 
3. The Ordinary Hyaluronic acid serum
4. First Aid Beauty Retinol 
5. Gua sha with rose hip seed oil!?!?
6. Kiehl’s facial moisturizer 

It feels wrong to put rose hip seed oil on my face after the retinol… like the oil would just strip that off. 

And it also feels wrong to then add more moisturizer over the oil after gua sha step.

Tonight is only my second night doing it this way but I welcome advice here before I keep going for too long! 

For the record, in the morning, I do the same steps, minus retinol or gua sha and I add spf before moisturizer.

TIA!

Some people say it was the best thing ever for their dry and compromised skin and others say not to use it on a damaged skin barrier as it can damage it further.

Studies have shown that it can strengthen the barrier, and still some people say it is sensitizing.

I have just started incorporating sunscreen into my routine for the mornings (better late than never I guess lol). I don’t wear makeup, and I wanted something that I could double as a protective sunscreen and moisturiser in one. This one stood out to me due to the high SPF, and that it doubles as a moisturiser. My skin has always been quite up and down in regard to break outs in small sections, so I’m not sure if I am breaking out because of this sunscreen, or if I am breaking out because of external reasons. 

I have normal-oily skin (I think? I have read all the forums in this group and my skin isn’t overly oily, and it’s never really dry) the sunscreen doesn’t make me any more or less oily than normal and I love the Matt finish it leave on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling quite smooth. I am going to start incorporating a hydrating toner into my morning and night routine soon (just haven’t bought it yet). Was just hoping for a little guidance on how long I should be using it for before determining whether or not the sunscreen is the issue or not, and also whether I should incorporate the toner now, or wait until I work out if the sunscreen is causing me issues.

Can anyone recommend products that will clear up keratosis pilaris that arent like, some sort of lotion of cream?

Sorry this feels like TMI but I’m incapable of posting something without giving as much context as possible lmao. I have keratosis pilaris really bad on my butt, and kinda on my legs, and a little bit on my arms. I’ve also struggled my whole life with bacne, which cleared up in highschool after being on acutane, but seems to have come back (but far less intense), however now when I look at it, the ‘zits’ looks more like the bad pimple-looking keratin plugs and bumpiness I have from the keratosis pilaris on the rest of my body. It also doesnt respond to any classic acne treatments or cleaners (which is how I figured out the problem with the skin on my ass was keratosis pilaris, and not butt acne). 

Here’s the problem - all the OTC treatments I can find recommended are all variations of some sort of lotion, moisturizer or cream. Also exfoliators and scrubs, but those only clear up the dead/dry skin, not the keratosis pilaris itself. And I HATE lotion on my body. I think its a sensory thing - I hate the greasy, slippery feeling of lotion on my legs whatsoever, no matter how high quality the lotion or how minimally it’s applied. I also recognize that never using body lotion is probably the primary cause of the dry skin conditions that brought on the KP in the first place. 

Are there any products/treatment options for KP that aren’t lotions? Ideally things that can be purchased over the counter, I’d really prefer to not go to a dermatologist.

So I just found out that my holy grail sunscreen - Biore UV Watery Essence SPF50+ PA++++ Aqua Rich has xylitol in it. I was not aware before now because it just never occurred to me that skincare could have xylitol in it, and the ingredient lists on my tubes have all been in Japanese until now. 

So it's gotta go. I have two Labradors, and xylitol is EXTRAORDINARILY toxic to dogs.

I've been using it for a couple years, so logically I know that if there was enough in it to be a problem as applied to my face, we'd probably have already had ER vet trips because of it (much as we've trained them not to - they still occasionally try to lick faces when they're excited). But regardless, now that I know, I'm just not comfortable having it in the house for fear they manage to get into the tube somehow (or on the off chance that there IS enough to be a problem as applied, and we've just been VERY LUCKY about them not managing to get in a proper lick while I'm wearing it).

So... any suggestions? Ideally that is not going to cost an arm/leg, and that will have a similar texture/effect on the skin (so, easy absorption, non-greasy, light formula, not super intense sunscreen smell)? And of course, with no xylitol.

I have been using jojoba oil more and more in my skin routine and have been really enjoying it lately. I have been using it like an oil cleanser, but I have just come to the realization that jojoba oil is technically a liquid wax. 

Am I technically not oil cleansing? If so, great! If not, I’m open to recommendations! I have tried castor oil and I found it gross and thick and would prefer not to use it.

1712426464.0,[Sun Care] Tinted Product that ONLY protects against visible light (no SPF),"So I’m a POC (Fitzpatrick 4) with combination, acne prone skin and hyperpigmentation. I understand that visible light protection is important for POC with hyperpigmentation, however I absolutely hate tinted sunscreens. They are simultaneously greasy and patchy on me, and I’ve tried a bunch of tinted sunscreens: CeraVe, Colorscience, EltaMd, Neutrogena.

I already have non-tinted sunscreens I love (from Korean brands) with spf 50 and PA++++. I can generously apply my Korean sunscreens and then put a layer of product specifically for visible light protection. In getting a product for visible light protection (but without spf), I’m hoping it will be more cosmetically elegant.

Are there any products (such as tinted moisturizers, foundations, skin tints) that have been tested and advertise visible light protection but aren’t sunscreens?

I understand that this isn’t as simple as finding a product with iron oxide: that the company has to test to verify their iron oxide particle size, quantity, and formulation actually offers some visible light protection.",SkincareAddiction

In addition to that I also have not as visible smile lines. Now I'm not really insecure about my smile lines but I am a bit insecure about those mid cheek lines. People tell me that I should sleep more even though I have a very good sleep schedule. They make me look tired and in addition to my smile lines they make me look like a 60 year old, especially from the side view.

It cleared up ALL of pimples and I've had pimple free skin since then.

I might have skin with no pimples but I have SEVERE TEXTURE AND CLOGGED PORES. I have lots of visible pores in my t zone and you I can literally see the sebum like overflowing from the pores. I have LOTS of blackheads, sebacious filaments, those like white things on my chin, tons of clogged pores, and whiteheads. I tried 3 different types of BHA products to clear this and I tested each one for 1-2x a week for 2 months and it makes no difference at all! It won't go away!

I went to a dermatologist and she recommended 0.15% retinol prescription to me but my mom didn't let me use it because she says I'm too young. My dermatologist also gave me this other salicylic acid product to try and after using it for months I have no results!!

Everyone says to deal with clogged pores and texture by using bha, aha, and glycolic acid but IT DOESNT WORK ON ME SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO TO GET RID OF IT IF THATS ALL PEOPLE TELL ME TO DO?!! 😭 I'm seriously starting to lose hope because even a dermatologist couldn't make my skin better! And I know some people will say that like I should accept my skin because its normal and all but I have a severe case of clogged pores and it is such an insecurity. I have like no confidence or self esteem mainly because I hate how I look and I can't fix that by just accepting myself the way I am. I just can't do that.

1712422161.0,[routine help] Perfecting my differin routine,"Differin is the only thing that keeps my skin clear, but I’m having trouble building a routine around using it. I’d ideally like to use as few products as possible: cleanser, daytime moisturizer with spf or with a separate spf, nighttime cream, and differin.

I’ve listed below my current routine plus successes and issues with the products. I feel like I am so close to finding the right routine after so much trial and error but I’m just not quite there yet.

AM

Water or LRP hydrating cleanser - my skin is better when I only use cleanser once a day but the aveeno cream listed below doesn’t rinse off with just water. I’ve debated switching to aveeno cleanser because maybe it’d be less irritating used twice a day. I’m wary that too many LRP products is too much niacinamide for my skin and is causing some level of irritation, but it seems fine with it in small amounts.

LRP Double Repair Moisturizer - my skin looks absolutely glowing after I use this. My only issue is that I need spf and my skin gets irritated from the spf version. I debated using it at night, but it’s probably too light to use with differin.

insert spf or spf moisturizer. Pretty lost on this one, chemical tends to be irritating but mineral tends to be drying.

PM

LRP hydrating cleanser - explained above

Aveeno eczema therapy cream (using this because my skin is SO dry and it seems to do well but it’s too occlusive to use differin before it (irritated my skin) and differin wont penetrate it if used after. I debated using it only on the nights I don’t use differin or using it in the morning but it’s heavy and I don’t know if spf will work effectively with it.

Differin (every other day) - Works to keep my skin clear. No other actives are necessary.

Last notes on irritants: my skin breaks out from: shea butter, the ceteareth-20 ceteareth alcohol combination (rules out most cetaphil, cerave, and vanicream products) and larger amounts of squalene and niacinamide tend to make me bumpy.",SkincareAddiction

1712418798.0,[Misc] Cult Classics vs. Post-COVID/2021 Innovations,"We know that skincare science is slow, however, there has been an explosion in the skincare industry since Covid and the market has greatly expanded. There are some iconic products that weren't just a trend; they made a tangible difference to the industry:

* Skinceuticals' Vitamin C (2005) formula being evidence based and synergising
* Sk-II's first time essence (1980) for the use of ferments
* The Ordinary's niacinamide serum (2016?) for ingredient focus and affordable price range

Do you think any product released (or reformulated) **since 2021**, has matched these classics or even done better?

What products or brands do you feel have pushed the skincare market even further - either they are **firsts**, the **bests** or **unique** in some way:

* **Efficacy** or potency (TO's AHA potion comes to mind): do products today outperform the classics?
* Improved or **synergistic formulas, advanced delivery** etc. (Regimen Lab's Vitamin X serum for their multiple anti-oxidants? although Paula's Choice also has anti-oxidant serums, encapsulation technology etc)
* Ingredients with more **evidence** behind them, perhaps a proven ratio (perhaps new sunscreen filters could fit here) or simply **responsiveness to new research** which we see in Asian beauty with reformulations
* Accessibility & Inclusivity (braille on packaging)
* Sustainability & Ethics (Hada Labo offers refill packets)
* Price vs performance (explosion in Asian beauty has led to more knowledge regarding affordable options)

Other highlights I have noticed: brands releasing **SPF products with multiple shade ranges** and more awareness about catering to different skin colours. I am **not** talking about products that are micro-trends. Another example (yet to see if it's a microtrend or here to stay) is the Reedle shot serums, although I don't know how new the technology itself is, it is the first time I am seeing the marketing 'microneedling in a bottle' so it has at least made a splash in that sense, as well as being an effective product.

Do you think the reason the cult classics are so, is because the skincare industry then was subpar? Would they still be so famous if released in today's day and age?

**TLDR: post-2021 products that could go up against cult classics vs classics that are irreplaceable**",SkincareAddiction
1712418526.0,[Sun care]I believe it's true that 80-90% of skin aging is caused by UV exposure based on my experience.,"For nearly a decade due to personal issues, I didn’t work or study,  spending most of my time indoors with the window shutters closed 24/7 to  avoid seeing my aunts and uncles. Thankfully, I resolved these issues  and began leading a healthy social life again. Upon re-entering society,  people often assumed I was 10 years younger than my actual age. Some  might argue that the lack of work or study-related stress contributed to  my youthful appearance. However, I was stressed about personal matters  and my future every day, indicating that stress wasn't the reason for my  youthful look. I concluded that avoiding UV exposure played a  significant role. Even after resuming my studies and work, I continued  to minimize UV exposure by avoiding activities like boating, hiking, and  camping, which I love, and stayed indoors during the day, venturing out  only at night. I applied sunscreen every three hours or even more  frequently, regardless of the season or if I was indoors, since windows  do not completely block UVA rays. Now, people often say I look more than  10 years younger than my actual age. A former classmate of mine, who is  Caucasian, works from home, and seldom goes outside, also appears much  younger than other acquaintances of the same age. Based on my  experience, I firmly believe that 80-90% of skin aging is indeed caused  by UV exposure. Therefore, using sunscreen is essential for UV  protection, but it may not be sufficient. Avoiding outdoor activities  during the day can further preserve youthful skin. Also, don't forget to  take vitamin D supplements if you're actively avoiding UV exposure.   ",SkincareAddiction

1712417086.0,[Personal] I ruined my skin for life and I hate myself for it.,"I used to have perfect skin and never did anything for it. Never cared for it, never paid attention to it. Everywhere I went I would get compliments on my skin.

Everything changed last year when I was introduced to skincare. I knew myself that I was not ready for it and that's why I never touched it. I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, OCD, and all of these led to the many stupid decisions made later.

I started getting into skincare knowing nothing about it, and made many silly mistakes, tried products I didn't understand the use for. It started breaking down my skin barrier.

Eventually I broke out in pustules and my skin texture changed. I went to my local GP and they prescribed me steroids, without telling me what it was, and gave me a longer dosage than I should've used it for. After my course of steroids, I broke out into more pustules.

I went back to my GP  and they gave me a course of antifungals. I fell into bad depression during this period and my skin got worse and worse on the antifungals.

My skin eventually got badly infected and I went to a dermatologist 4 months later.

Now im left with many skin conditions (rosacea, seb derm, dermatographism) to deal with for the rest of my life, and a badly scarred face. Now I have to spend so much money and mental energy trying to help my skin, but my skin is not caring.

Every time i look in the mirror i just wanna rip my face off. I don't think I will be able to recover from this physically and mentally. I was not a very confident person to begin with already and this just greatly killed my confidence and quality of life.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just needed to rant :(

1712393170.0,[Personal] I ruined my clear skin and it destroys my life,"tw: eating disorder

this post highlights my poor life choices and ridiculous value system called out by skin condition. 

Hello, I’m 22f. I used to have mild acne ever since I hit puberty until I went to a derm at 20 y.o.. It was in June 2022. The skincare routine that I was prescribed back then was rather simple and effective, and I was happy with my skin quality after 3-4 weeks of doing it. I felt very confident showing up my face in public or when taking selfies. 

In October 2022 I moved to Japan for college. I stopped having access to the products that I’d been using in my home country. At that point I didn’t really know about skincare much, and I just blindly followed the recommendations of my derm, I was lucky enough it worked on me that soon, but it tricked me into belief that my skin would remain clear even though I’d switched to different products. Well, yeah it was a naive idea. 

In addition to new skincare, I had to get used to a completely different lifestyle and climate. In my home country I was living with my parents, and it’s not that I wasn’t cooking or doing any chores, it’s just that we shared them. So, after I moved out it all came down on me, and it’s been causing a lot of stress, as I have to take care of home chores all by myself and be successful at school simultaneously, which I have to admit I find extremely difficult (I know it’s a baby rant, but I have to be honest about it). As a result, I happened to have less time and energy to prepare food and I started eating out way too often. It’s important to mention that I have gastritis and acid reflux, and my stomach doesn’t mind to give me feedback any time I ate anything it didn’t like the slightest. While I was living at home it was easy to maintain a healthy diet, I had a lot of time and inspiration to cook for myself, but now I’m nothing like that and my diet is poor as shit.

[a little throwback in time] I picked up that healthy diet since June 2021 due to my stomach’s breakdown. Well, I picked it up and I lost weight quickly, I lost my period as well. However, I wasn’t worrying about my missing period at the beginning, as I was rather flattered by the fact of being ✨skinny✨
Long story short, I developed an eating disorder but I thought that the diet was good for me because of my stomach issues. It was actually good for my stomach, but I just wasn’t eating enough calories, thus, I kept loosing weight. I winded up being underweight for over a year, telling everyone that I’m healthy and feeling better this way! Oh, yes, you’re, yes, you’re!!! Thinking about food 90% of the time and having severe food anxiety!!! Man, that’s the definition of well-being!
At the end of the day, after I lost my capacity to cook for myself for the most part, I couldn’t help but started eating more unhealthy and high in calorie diet, which from this point of view is not even that bad. 

But the total waking-up from my ed happened after my skin started giving me hell. Japanese summer is very hot and humid which is nothing like back in my home country. Imagine what happens to the pore-clogging and acne prone skin in these conditions??? Right, it gives you worse pore clogging and acne. Over the course of 4 months (June - October) I developed acne as bad as I had never had. 
By then, I learned about skincare online, and I knew that the most effective thing to fight acne was retinol. I could get my hands on 💫differin gel💫, and so I did. 
And this is the part where it’s getting worse… I expected purging but I got irritated skin and face flushing after like a month of using differin. I applied it the  “sandwich method”, and I was building it up gradually, and I wore sunscreen daily, but my skin didn’t care it was getting more red and damaged. So I quit differin after 2 months.
My skin was so sensitive it flashed of hot air, drinks, food and ANY type of stress. Remember I live in Japan? By the way, my Japanese is far from great, it’s not that shitty, but my speed of speech and choice of words make me look retarded sometimes, so I’d feel embarrassed speaking it anyway. But when your face is covered in pimples and goes red, you feel even more embarrassed and the flare up goes wild.

So, I got pretty scared of this, and I went to ask Dr. Google about it. I learned that my symptoms and triggers were very similar to hot flushes women usually experience in their menopause. Well, call me stupid I absolutely deserved that, but this was the first time I had my eyes opened on why my missing period was bad for me. I started eating everything I could to restore my weight and hopefully get my period back. I went to doctors and I got all those tests. I was ENORMOUSLY lucky to get my period naturally in March after 1.5 years of amenorrhea (I had it in 2022 on pill, but stopped taking meds after I moved to Japan). 
I also went to a derm to learn I have developed rosacea. I was prescribed a new routine, and after one month of doing it I see good progress. However, it’s sooooo far away from the skin quality I used to have back in July 2022 - January 2023 (the moment it started to be getting worse).

I decided to write it all down, as I’ve been comparing my current self with the skinny and smooth-skinned former version of me. I can’t help but look at those old pictures pretty much every day, and it’s literally driving me insane. 
My confidence has died, and I don’t know if I ever be able to fully recover my skin. It’s unbelievable how much my appearance means to me. I’m so mentally drained.

After 2x cleansing (I stopped using cerave bc it made my face so dry and sensitive but one day in the shower I tried washing with an ivers bar soap and following with my second cleanse of the aveeno oat gentle cleanser, and my face felt clean and non irritated???? I ended up just sticking with doing this for the past couple of weeks!) 

At night:
Anua toner on damp skin 
Arazlo (3x a week)
Vani 
Sudo cream around nose (have rashes)
(1x a week during the night I use Paula’s)

Morning:
Warm water cleanse (no cleanser)

Azaleic acid (everymorning)

1712391796.0,[Product Request] Combination girly in need of help: niacinamide? aha bha?,"Hello all. I - 20F - am having a bit of trouble with my skin recently.
First of all. I have no idea the type of skin I have: in my teens, so up until just a couple years ago, i would have said I had normal to dry skin around the nose area, didn't produce too much sebum and only had the occasional pimple every once in a while or during/right before my period. Lately, however, I've been noticing my skin gets a bit oily throught the day, specially if it's hot out, while during the winter it doesnt feel dry as much: the worst i get is right in the morning, I'm just a diff type of oily right when I wake up and go wash my face, i'm literally dewy (nose area especially). As of pimples I haven't noticed anything more than the occasional pimple when I'm stressed and/or on my period, so that's something at least.

Having said that, I would like to keep the oilyness at bay a bit more as it can get annoying at times, especially when i'm out all day and only get home and wash my face at 7pm. What can I do? I have heard niacinamide has sebum control properties but have never used it: i live in Italy and the only niacinamide I could find were The ordinarv's and the inkey list's, but have heard contrasting opinions about them, as some said their concentration (10%) was way too strong and got them to be more oily then before. In the past l've used the ordinary's AHA/BHA red peeling solution and loved it, i feel less oily the morning after using it and the days after that and my skin feels way softer; so I was thinking of going back to that as I haven't used it in a while, mainly because I honestly forget

Right now my routine consists of cerave SA smoothing cleanser (i know it says dry skin but it kinda worked for me + it contains Salicylic acid so i felt like it could exfoliate a bit daily; also the green classic one leaves me oily in 5 minutes) and a moisturizer that i love from an italian brand (the only moisturizer that doesnt' leave me oily and actually moisturizes my skin).

Any help will be highly, extremely appreciated, thanks!!!!",SkincareAddiction

1712389182.0,[Routine Help] Stubborn flesh coloured bumps on neck and collarbones,"My neck, chest, upper arms and upper back are covered in these small flesh coloured bumps and I don't know how to get rid of them! I also have them on the lower half of my face, especially on my chin, but I have been using Epiduo for 2 months and it seems to be slowly helping, though it's hard to tell for sure. I have had them on my face for 10 years (minus a few years on accutane), but never on my neck or collarbones like this until recently. I haven't changed anything in my routine. I am 27F and I have very acne prone skin. I think they might be closed comedones because if I squeeze them, sometimes a white substance comes out. 

Face routine:

Morning: Rinse with water, Purito re-barrier cream or Cancer Council Matte SPF 50+ if I am going outside.

Evening: Wash with Femfresh sensitive wash (weird but I like it, has some lactic acid in it), Purito re-barrier cream, Epiduo (every second night), Ureaderm cream (10% Urea) on nights I don't use Epiduo

Body: I have tried salicylic acid washes and a sulfur soap in the shower for my neck and upper body to try help the bumps but it doesn't seem to have any effect, so I have just started using my normal soap again (Aveeno Skin Relief Body Wash). I am at a loss. I don't want to have to use any expensive creams to try fix this issue because the bumps cover such a large area of skin and I can't afford that! I am wondering if my skin has an issue with keratin/hyperkeratosis because I am seriously one bumpy lady lol.

Does anyone deal with these on their body? What can I do? TIA!

1712370766.0,[Routine Help] WYD for insanely dry skin? ," So, I’m 23, have VERY dry skin and I’m not really sure why. It could be that I have to take antihistamines almost daily, or that I use cetaphil soap due to eczema which is both gentle but super drying. That being said, I know nothing about skincare because I’ve never really needed it… I never normally breakout, I don’t normally have any other issues, in fact, the only time I’ve tried to do things for my skin is when I break out.

I use cerave moisturizer on my face every day. It used to be after a shower only but I started applying it 4-5 times in a single night in a LAYER just to get more moisturized and it soaks it up endlessly until I give up. I’m half convinced I could put on as much as I wanted and it would find somewhere to go. My face even wrinkles it’s so dry, and I’m getting fine lines on my forehead and between my eyebrow because of how it creases when it’s dry. It gets itchy and tight feeling as well, and no amount of moisturizer is saving me. Tips?? 

I just bought vitamins, I bought a face serum by COSRX that’s a 6 peptide booster even though I don’t know what it means 😂 will this help? And how do I use it? ",SkincareAddiction

1712364148.0,[Review] Inkey List 10% Azelaic Acid Serum,"You guys. This serum changed my liiiifffeee. 

This is the best my skin has looked in *years*. 

I've been using the same routine for about 6 months, with 2 exceptions. Firstly, I started using a different sunscreen in February because my HG was reformulated into trash. This sunscreen is nothing special, it doesn't have treatments. It's just a good sensitive skin sunblock. 

And then, around the same time, I started using the azelaic acid from Inkey List to help with my rosacea redness.

My skin's redness has disapated by 90%.  Not only that, the stubborn and constant acne I had been fighting the Fall cleared up within 10 days. My skin is the smoothest and softest it has been since I was a child. My skin inflammation? Gone. Dryness? Don't know her. 

I cut out all other actives (including retinols and bha/ahas) except vitamin C. It was meant to be temporary (I was only using these things occasionally anyway, except retinol 2x a week) to see how my skin would react to the azelaic acid alone and y'all... I'm not going back. 

It's been about 6 weeks and I am SHOOK. I am also getting tons of compliments on my skin all of sudden. Have no cons really other than it dries down a little dry but goes away as soon as I moisturize.  I highly recommend this product if you have mild to moderate cystic acne, skin inflammation, uneven skin texture, and persistent flushing and redness. 

Packaging is a basic black and white squeeze tube, does a great job not squeezing too much out, easy to use cream-like consistency. No detectable scent. ",SkincareAddiction
1712363050.0,[Sun Care] Window in my new kitchen. Should I be concerned about the UV?,"Hi everyone.I recently moved to a house where there are a lot of windows. In my room, I have installed blackout curtains over the normal blinds, and a smaller, second window  covered with aluminium foil. But since i am living with my parents, the kitchen and the living room is a shared area so i can't just do things at my will like i did to my own room.

I go to get breakfast around 9am (when UV index can be anywhere between 2-4) every day and i have to be around the kitchen for a few minutes, and there is a big window there. I get anxious about the UVA rays, because according to my research, while an average window can block most UVB, it will let in more than 50% of UVA which is bad for your face. 

And the bathroom also has a small window and likewise i can't really put foil over it since it's shared. So every time i get up to wash my face i am exposed to some UV? 

It's going to take a lot to try and convince my parents to install UV sheets everywhere.. can i get some tips",SkincareAddiction

1712361246.0,[Routine Help] So Many Actives to Choose From!,"Hi all!

I'm currently going through a bit of a skin care routine overhaul, and I'd appreciate some help. Currently, I'm rotating between using in the PM Adapalene one night, and Lactic acid 10% + Azelaic Acid 10% the other, with one day off a week. I also use the Caudalie Vinoperfect Serum in the AM, and have various products with low % niacinamide.

I'm first of all looking to switch out Adapalene with Tretinoin when I finish my current tube, but I'm also wondering if after my skin has gotten used to tret, whether it'd be worth switching up some of my other actives? I'm dealing with quite a few closed comedones, some uneven texture, and the occasional acne flair up, normally around my period. I deal with some red spots left by the acne, but the Vinoperfect that I introduced in the last few weeks seems to be helping that.

There's so many different actives out there, I'm not sure where to begin. Would it be worth switching out my AHA with BHA? What about Vitamin C? Is a copper peptide worth looking into? Should I use bakuchiol alongside a Vitamin A derivative? Should I try to decrease my Vitamin A derivative usage and up my exfoliant usage, or vice versa? Basically, any advice on actives would be very appreciated!

Hypochlorous acid is a very hot ingredient right now.  All the other HA mists on the market contain HA, water and nothing else.

The mister is lovely - very even and soothing.  Please buy it!  It’s sold on the pixi website and target.

Naeli Naturals - I never hear anything about this brand.  It’s an indie brand with a great product lineup.  I suffer from hyperpigmentation and their Kojic acid serum is the BEST I’ve ever used.  It contains Niacinimide and zinc and azelaic acid so it’s also anti acne and oil controlling.  It contains azelaic acid derivative APAD as well as Kojic acid, alpha arbutin, symwhite and other ingredients for discoloration.  It contains antioxidants glutathione and resveratrol.  It also contains licorice and strawberry extract.  Finally for hydration it has hyaluronic and aloe.  Nothing has ever worked this well for me.  The ingredients are in meaningful concentrations and most percentages are listed on the website.  It’s well priced and occasionally goes on sale for buy 2 get one free. Obsessed.  You should try it!!

Finally, inkey list ceramide serum (not moisturizer).  No one ever talks about this and I don’t know why.  THREE PERCENT ceramides, four different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid totaling 2.5%, loads of amino acids (which are an unsung skincare hero IMO), cholesterol and a number of other goodies.  And it’s affordable.  This is my HG hydration/barrier product.  Why would anyone buy another ceramide or hyaluronic acid product when this exists?

[Routine Help],"I’ve happily used a cleanser with salicylic acid for the past 4-5 years, which has done wonders at keeping my T-zone clear as it is prone to oiliness and acne. Gentler cleansers don’t do the trick and I’m confident in my routine here now. However, I also have rosacea and have recently flared up with Type 2 on my cheeks for the first time - so I ideally want to switch to a gentler, non-active cleanser in that area to protect the more sensitive areas, BUT whilst continuing to prevent acne in my T-zone with my original cleanser. 

Is this a thing, or a waste of my time to consider/too complicated? 
Is there a best way to do this, that won’t cause any interactions?

I have really dark, coarse hair. I was told not to use any type of physical or chemical exfoliant for at least 72 hours and not to use any moisturizer that’s too thick or oily, as it could clog the open pores…but I’ve also been told that I should use a strong, oil based moisturizer or even an AHA moisturizer. With the products I have on hand, I was considering using a combination of Aloe Vera gel and Rosehip Seed Oil for the first couple days…Just wondering if that sounds reasonable, or will the Rosehip oil make me more susceptible to ingrowns?

Hi guys! Okay so I have a history of dry lips since the pandemic and it has only gotten worse over the past years, but not like chronically. I’ve never been to the doctor for my lips bcos it wasn’t that serious so I didn’t put much thought into it. But recently, I joined this job, where the air is SUPER dry and stuffy, and i suspect that is the cause of my recent outbreak of dry lips (Like this time it’s worse than usual).

If u search up Cheilitis 94 Impetigo, I suspect that’s what Im currently suffering from, but the mild version. It’s red, and it’s flaky, specifically my upper lip, when’s Im in a dry environment for too long. 

Here is the catch. I’ve been putting QV lip balm (works wonders for me till now), but the cuts on my upper lip due to the dryness oozes out yellow liquid??? So everytime i put on my lip balm, which is waterproof, the liquid just gets trapped behind the lip balm, creating this disgusting bubble. 

So idk what to do. Should i go to the doctors? Should i stop using lip balm? Like it’s really affecting my mental health because I don’t feel good w this condition. Is it even curable????",SkincareAddiction

1712339097.0,[Acne] 30/f have had acne for 15 years and tried EVERYTHING and now have seriously low self-esteem - tips needed,"Hey all :) I hope you're all doing well.

I'm sorry to post something that's probably been posted a million times before, but I'm having a really bad mental health week with my skin, and I'm just looking for some last-ditch-attempt advice.

I've had acne since I was 15. I was on antibiotics for YEARS when I was younger. I've been on Accutane once, which cleared it for a year or so. I've been on spiro, which improved it, but I wasn't able to stay on this long-term for a host of reasons. The pill helped, but made me an emotional wreck, and I'd prefer to avoid the post-pill acne risk as I potentially want children in the next 3/4 years so would have to come off it anyway. I've tried all the main topicals.

I've done the natural thing too - had my hormones tested by a specialist, which showed low estrogen, and they recommended loads of stuff based on this which I do.... obsessively (it's kinda impacted my mental health, tbh). Namely, gluten-free/dairy-free diet, lots of protein but minimal simple carbs, mainly whole foods, some supplements, minimal caffeine, lots of veg etc.

So, my acne is definitely better than it was at one point but it's still consistent, mainly around my chin and jawline, all cycle long now, though worse during ovulation and before my period. I get cysts on my jaw and the ones on my chin start as little tiny whiteheads, stay like that for a while, and then randomly grow into a  full spot at some point.

I was wondering if anyone could take a look at my skincare routine and let me know if I'm perhaps doing something wrong, before I give in and go on Accutane again. I've done a ton of research and have tried to include things without commonly pore-clogging ingredients, but am I missing something?

My online dermatologist prescription company has recommended trying topical Clindamycin with the tret, which I'm tempted to accept, as it's really bad at the moment. Still, I'm worried what will happen once I come off as I know it can't be long-term.

AM:

* Cleanse with water only (only started this in the past week, after doing some research)
* Geek & Goregous Hydration Station all over
* Acnecide SPF30 all over

PM

* Oil cleanse with The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser
* Second cleanse with Simple Hydrating Gel Wash
* Tret 0.04% + 4% Azalaic Acid cream (Uncouth prescription) - Every other day, or I find it too drying
* Topical spiro 5% cream (this is a new addition - only been using two weeks - as recommended by Uncouth)
* Geek & Gorgeous Hydration Station
* Drop of The Ordinary Squalene Oil for a bit of extra hydration

I have stopped wearing makeup on my acne (three weeks ago) and now only wear concealer under my eyes, plus mascara/eyebrow makeup.

Around one week ago, I had been using Avene A-D Lipid Repleneshing Cream at night time instead of the G&G product. I was worried this could be what's clogging me up, so have removed it for now. I can definitely feel more dryness kicking in, but I thought the only way to figure out if fatty alcohols/silicones etc are contributing, would be to cut them out completely.

I don’t want to do too much because I do know too many products can make things worse, but I do want to try all these products to see what is best for me since the one product made such a huge difference. My dermatologist recently went through my whole previous routine and told me my toners and serums were unnecessary with my listed prescriptions (at the time, the same toners listed here and Glossier Supers (A Vitamin C serum, a Hyaluronic Acid serum, and a Niacinamide serum), but when I took those things out of my routine, my skin got dryer and duller and my acne got worse, so I’m interested in adding those ingredients back in.

Sorry for all the info, hoping someone who is passionate about skincare and ingredients can help me out!

EDIT:

I think I’m going to do the following based on feedback!

• Azelaic acid/Salicylic acid (Brightfacial) should not be used with Benzoyl Peroxide (Clindamycin), move one of these to PM

• Glycolic acid toner should not be used with Adapalene, replace with Micellar water for second cleanse

• Vitamin C also cancels out Benzoyl Peroxide, but should be used in AM. Benzoyl cancels out Adapalene. Consider moving Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide to PM and swap with Adapalene every other night

• If the above doesn’t work, eliminate Vitamin C, keep Clindamycin/Benzoyl Peroxide in AM, move Brightfacial to PM

• Use Micellar water and rinse in AM before toner with HA

• Only use Babyfacial every 2-4 weeks to replace in-office chemical peels

1712331305.0,[Hair Removal] Epilating and Aftercare Issue,"Hi, umm, I posted this on a different subreddit, but never got a response so I'm hoping that I might be able to get a bit of help here. So, I got an epilator about a month back and uh...ha...haha...I might have messed my legs up some. I've been using neosporin on the worst spots for a couple of weeks now and switching between aloe vera and cerave sa lotion each day on my entire legs since then and they still look really bad.

I really messed up the very first time I think through a combination of not exfoliating before nor after, not realizing exactly how thick my leg hair is, and running the epilator across my legs too fast originally...

In case anybody has any advice to help my legs heal faster and for me to feel like less of an idiot going forward, here's some pics from about a week ago: https://imgur.com/a/UDxXy1l

1712331023.0,[Routine help] Niacinamide? AHA/BHA?,"Hello all. I - 20F - am having a bit of trouble with my skin recently.
First of all. I have no idea the type of skin I have: in my teens, so up until just a couple years ago, i would have said I had normal to dry skin around the nose area, didn't produce too much sebum and only had the occasional pimple every once in a while or during/right before my period. Lately, however, I've been noticing my skin gets a bit oily throught the day, specially if it's hot out, while during the winter it doesnt feel dry as much: the worst i get is right in the morning, I'm just a diff type of oily right when I wake up and go wash my face, i'm literally dewy (nose area especially). As of pimples I haven't noticed anything more than the occasional pimple when I'm stressed and/or on my period, so that's something at least.

Having said that, I would like to keep the oilyness at bay a bit more as it can get annoying at times, especially when i'm out all day and only get home and wash my face at 7pm. What can I do? I have heard niacinamide has sebum control properties but have never used it: i live in Italy and the only niacinamide I could find were The ordinarv's and the inkey list's, but have heard contrasting opinions about them, as some said their concentration (10%) was way too strong and got them to be more oily then before. In the past l've used the ordinary's AHA/BHA red peeling solution and loved it, i feel less oily the morning after using it and the days after that and my skin feels way softer; so I was thinking of going back to that as I haven't used it in a while, mainly because I honestly forget

Right now my routine consists of cerave SA smoothing cleanser (i know it says dry skin but it kinda worked for me + it contains Salicylic acid so i felt like it could exfoliate a bit daily; also the green classic one leaves me oily in 5 minutes) and a moisturizer that i love from an italian brand (the only moisturizer that doesnt' leave me oily and actually moisturizes my skin - i'm leaving the ingredients in the pic).

1712327643.0,10 Week Skin Update [B&A],"I am in my mid-20s with acne-prone combination skin. Back in October, I started experiencing a hormonal acne breakout. Here is how I went from 20+ active pimples at a time (cysts, whiteheads, CCs) to NO active breakouts for about a month now. 

Please see the 3rd picture for my current routine!! Cleanser, clindamycin, azelaic acid (for scarring), moisturizer, and SPF in the morning. Cleanser, tretinoin, moisturizer, cicaplast on my nose (for SFs), and aquaphor around my eyes and mouth at night. Clay mask or TO mask around once a week. 

Here are what I think were the biggest changes:
- removing B vitamins and niacinamide. I stopped taking a multivitamin that had both of these, and switched from LRP toleriane products that contain niacinamide. I use the toleriane cleanser a few times a week because I don’t want the bottle to go to waste, and it doesn’t seem to be breaking me out- I think it was the combination of many B vitamin/niacinamide products. 
- tretinoin! Game changer. I started with OTC adapalene gel and purged for about a month (not shown). Saw some improvement, but much much more once I started tret. 
- consistency. I make sure to wash my face twice a day, every day. I was doing this most of the time beforehand, but not all the time. It has to be every day!!

What I did NOT do:
- change my diet. I eat decently healthy but I do eat some fried food, dairy, processed sugar, etc. 
- change my pillowcase every day- don’t have time for all that laundry. 
 
I am very happy with my new skin!! This routine even stopped my monthly breakouts around my period! Happy to answer any questions :)",SkincareAddiction

1712319724.0,[Sun Care] why is my face like 10x lighter than the rest of my body when it all used to be completely the same??," this isn't really that relevant  to this subreddit but this is the closest subreddit i could find to what i'm asking i guess there's no other subreddits closer

plus it says anything and everything about skin

anyway my skin colour is actually crazily uneven and idk why or how to fix it.

btw none of these hex things are 100% accurate they could be lighter or darker they're just SIMILAR i js can't find exact matches

my arms are similar to #ab7c46

my legs are similar to #c4975c

the lightest part of my face is #f1d1b9 and #dfb596 (this was colour dropped but in bright unnatural lighting so idk how accurate it is)

and the lightest parts of my body that just never see sunlight are #e6d9be (also colourdropped) OR the skin tone of my legs. my neck (also colourdropped) is #f0dabb

the thing is when i was younger my skin tone was completely even, like it was all the same. it was closest to the colour of my arms or legs and ever since i was like 12 every other part of my body just got really lighter. i'm 15 now and those parts of my body have just gotten even lighter.

mum is white from england and my dad is brown from chile (he is mestizo but has more indigenous ancestry). i'm australian so there's crazy sun but i never go out anyway. my mum is SLIGHTLY tanned bc we live in australia but her relatives (all of them live in england) are very pale, while my dad's relatives are either darker or paler than him but still similar to my old skin tone and his skin tone (his relatives in aus are darker than the ones in chile but there are still dark and light ones in either country). what happened to my skin colour and how do i get it back to how it used to be? 

idk what happened, i never even got a sunburn until i was like 12 when my skin started being lighter. now i get sunburned on my face and chest. i still never get sunburned on my arms, and i know that my arms/legs aren't just tanned bc i've been like that since when i was a baby. when i was a baby i was slightly lighter than when i was say 7 but not nearly as light as i am now. 

i'm not asking for products on how to make my skin darker or whatever but i kinda js wanna know why i'm lighter now it really confuses me. plus my dad is always saying i need to go back to my 'natural brown' which i want anyway but it feels like something i should b raising my eyebrow at.

btw i have sleep issues so for the past year i've been really unactive during the day and only at nighttime when there's zero sun. i don't go out into the sun like ever but when i do i get sunburned on my face n chest like is this js lack of sunlight or has some weird genetics thing happened to my skin idk??",SkincareAddiction

1712302284.0,[Routine Help] Red marks under the eyes after starting skin care.,"Im 16. Started skin care recently (been 2 weeks or so) to treat low-mild acne and better my skin tone from hyperpigmentation (which I suspect I have - (even if i dont then skin care is win nevertheless). I have kept the routine fairly simple - a cleanser - (Cetaphil daily facial cleanser), a moisturizer - (Cerave PM moisturizer), a sunscreen - (from Isntree), retinol- (differen gel adapelene 0.1% and recently got a serum - (Versed stroke of brilliance). Have used the serum just once - planning to use it as little as possible (2-3 times a week)- (upon research Vitamin C or serum in general are not necessary for teens). Other than the serum - the other three products - I have used it regularly for the past 2 weeks or so. At first, I used excessive cleanser (not aware of the right amount -of course) - (two pumps - when 1 would be more reasonable). Then after being aware of the right amount of cleanser to be used - I immediately implemented it in the routine. The little incident caused redness and irritation around the under eyes area and beside the nose area- (The cheeks and area further from were fine). After implementing the right amount - no irritation occurred but some redness still remained. The most fascinating thing is when I apply the moisturizer it kind of burns around under eyes area. I lessened the amount of the moisturizer but how much ever the amount was there was the burning and caused the redness to increase. But after a couple of minutes, it will cool down and there will be no irritation or burning. But the redness around the more sensitive area (under eye and sometimes sides of the nose) still remained. Recently this worsened - there is a mark - not just redness but mark which is very dry (got a different texture than other part of the skin). The face produces white flakes ( because of the increased dyness - i guess). There is absolutely no problem with the sunscreen and the differen gel (it causes severe dryness but its normal). I am not certain of the cleanser and the moisturizer. I am quite suspicious of the moisturizer as it literally burns in the sensitive areas. The cleanser works fine with the skin with the right amount but cause redness - not severe ( idk if thats normal). I dont want to worsen the red mark under my eyes so havent applied any product expect for sunscreen (very much essential). The red mark seems to heal - i guess. Not as severe as it was two days ago. But there is increased dryness - (production of white flakes suggests so). Now I stuck in this situation where Im afraid of applying the moisturizer, but the skin really needs it. And I have the complete skin routine (with all the products) finally but I cant continue. From my best guess - I have dry and sensitive skin. What would suggest me to do here? Any experienced individual? Im confused on why the moisturizer cause would this as it contains all good ingredients (niacinamide, ceramides and others) and is from a well-established brand. I currently am not in the situation to switch moisturizer as I just barely persuaded my parents to buy. Probably after 2 months or so could get a new one. So any suggestions. How can I treat the ""mark"" faster? Shoud I continue with the routine? Or is it that the skin being introduced with products all of a sudden is giving me these reactions so I should gradually increase the amount and continue with the routine? Anything advice will help and would be greatly appreciated.",SkincareAddiction
1712301808.0,[Personal] Really need help with my accutane dilemma.,"Before anyone asks, yes I've contacted my dermatologist and we will speak soon. But until then, I really need some advice.

Context: Male, 21, 67kg (147lbs) bodyweight, started 40mg daily in mid-December, was bumped down to 30mg last week.

The results were great even a month in, and have continued to get better. My face is essentially fully clear, my back acne is gone, and I get like one pimple every week, if that. I'm happy with that side of things.

Now for that bad part. I have never had a history of mental health issues. Never had depression, anxiety, any of that, and I am grateful for that. However, these past 2 months, I've been plagued with negative emotion, anxiety, unease, and intense sadness and emotional sensitivity like never before in my life.

It's been dark, and difficult, and a lot to deal with every single day. Only in recent days have I made the link that it could be the accutane amplifying this. There have been some life events which acted as triggers, but my emotional reaction has been really severe and prolonged, and not ""like me"" at all.

So here's the deal: I want to get off the drug, but I don't want my acne to come back - I really don't want a relapse after having the acne for so long and being on the drug for many months already. I don't want to repeat a whole course all over again.

Am I at risk of relapsing since I was on a low dose and haven't reached my cumulative dose yet?

I usually just wear moisturizer under it and my morning routine takes me under one hour. I tried to use sunscreen, but it was such a time consuming „step“ that I really don’t understand how y‘all are able to wear it every day and incorporate it into your life. 

It starts with applying: If I apply too much, it will crust, so I apply it in small layers and wait for it to dry. Even if I just apply a single layer, I have to wait for approximately 30 minutes before putting on makeup. My next issue is that you should reapply your sunscreen every 2-3 hours, but how am I supposed to do that with makeup 😭 a spray sunscreen messed my makeup up and a stick isn’t working for me neither. Another problem is that my makeup looks more cakey and my facial hair is covered in sunscreen, and I can feel the sunscreen throughout the whole day. It also seems like any makeup (drugstore to highend) is have tried does not like the sunscreens I have tried, even though I make sure not to mix oils, water, silicones etc.

1712291415.0,[Routine Help]- Adding a serum or...?,"I'm currently thinking I want to adopt skincare that adds to my skin (like vitamins/peptides etc) instead of takes away(chemical exfoliation). I'm nervous about exfoliation because I still think I have time before getting into a routine with chemical exfoliation because I want to build a sustainable routine and don't want to mess with my natural state?? Turnover?? I have ""good skin"". It looks grey and dull when it's not doing too hot and I have CCs on my chin that are visible when stretched but im okay with the journey so far.

what should I add to boost radiance? 

I'm currently considering switching to vanicream and adding the Mary and May idebenone and blackberry serum or a seabuckthorn serum.

I'm mid-20's with melanated skin and I have finally found a moisturiser in the past year that works well for my skin- my skin feels hydrated, I understand what ""elasticity"" feels like for my skin and I've experienced more even skin tone finally. The moisturiser is Fresh Black Tea anti-aging. However, it is VERY expensive and I want to try and narrow down what exactly my skin is responding to so well in this moisturiser so I can exore further.

This is my current routine:

AM- no cleanser,(sometimes hydrating essence sunscreen, Fresh moisturiser

PM- cleanse with cleanser, hydrating essence, Fresh moisturiser, rosehip oil

1x/week AHA/BHA mask

This is working for me, I saw a massive reduction in the tiny CCs on my nose that were untouched by everything except tretinoin 0.5%.

Ingredients my skin has previously liked: vitamin e, ceramides, squalene, sometimes niacinamide

1712289396.0,[Routine Help] Retinol when not using Tret? & Help with Uneven Skin Tone?,"Hiya! Just a quick question for you guys

Are you able to use a mild retinol on the days you’re not using tret?

I’m a beginner when it comes to tret, but I’ve been using the retinol serum by Olay for a year now on and off. So I started tret cream at 0.25 last week (Beauty Bliss) targeted for fine lines. My plan is to use tret once a week with buffing; I’m extra cautionary, because my sensitive skin doesn’t respond well to drying or harsh products. However, should I use my retinol that I use nightly on the nights I don’t use tret? Or should I just stick to tret once a week (at least for right now)?

Also, would anyone know how to get rid of uneven skin tone? I’m not exactly sure what to call it, but I have like a translucent uneven splotchy look to my face. It doesn’t look opaque and even, and it bothers me so much, but nothing I’ve done seems to fix it, but I wouldn’t say it’s hyperpigmentation either, because I don’t get acne there

*It’s possible I irritated my skin barrier, and I noticed this uneven skin tone after reintroducing the retinol after only using the tret once a week for a week so far.. Hmmm",SkincareAddiction

Every morning when I wake up, my eyes are super puffy. My upper and lower lids are visibly swollen. After an hour or so, my upper lids go back to normal, so they’re not really my main concern here. My concern is that my lower eyelids stay puffy throughout the day and it makes me look super tired. I get told all the time that I look tired. Sometimes I feel like it ruins my face. Makeup can’t even cover the bags under my eyes. 

I’ve tried everything! Dozens of eye creams and serums, drinking more water, getting more sleep, cold and warm compress, eye drops, gua sha, etc. It only seems to make it worse. Surprisingly, the only time the puffiness goes away is when I’ve been awake for a very long period of time.

Just for context, I’m only 18, so it’s not anything related to aging. I’ve also seen an eye doctor and they couldn’t really find anything wrong. I have also had blood work done for my thyroid, and everything came back normal, so it’s not that.

It feels like someone is pulling it even after my skincare routine and my makeup cracks the second I put it on and absolutely won't last all day. I also have very acne prone and dull skin. My routine looks like this:

Morning:
Cerave foaming oil cleanser,
Cosrx snail essence 95%,
Geek & Gorgeous C-glow serum,
Cosrx snail cream 92%,
La roche posay cicablast b5

Evening is the same but without the vitamin C, and I often use the Nivea blue tin instead of the cicaplast. The nivea cream is sometimes the only thing that takes away the pulling feeling. So I have no acids, no retinol no nothing. Why am I so dry? I drink a lot of water so I don't think it's that either. I like squalane but not even that is enough and I can't seem to find a good moisturiser. And I don't want to buy many products in vain, I don't know where to start. Please help me!

I used the exfoliator once in a week. The mistake I had made was that both the facewash and the moisturizer are for dry or normal skin, whereas I had pretty oily skin. Throughout this routine, I had minor breakouts that were manageable and not too noticeable, but I kept going.

About two weeks ago, I accidentally used too much of the exfoliator (the pack instructs me to apply a thin layer on my skin) and applied it a bit liberally and perhaps even a bit harshly too. A couple of days later, I started having a major breakout on my forehead, cheeks and nose (all places where I usually get acne). I thought it was because of the facewash and the moisturizer and changed them to:

I have had used these two products for the first week and later discontinued using the moisturizer as I was advised against it by my friend (who is no expert, by the way) since I had oily skin and also because I had read that salicylic acid causes purging, and I wanted to get my acne under control as quickly as possible. I even stopped using sunscreen in fear of clogging up the pores and instead started using an umbrella.

Initially I thought it was skin purging because of the exfoliator, but can it be skin purging that was triggered by the high amount used at one instance if I had been using the product for at least a month?

For the last few days, I had started applying crushed camphor (mixed with some water) on the affected areas. It did help reduce acne on one of my cheeks, but the other areas haven't improved at all. This was something that treated my acne effectively when I was 16 after I started doing it after watching a random YouTube video.

My skin sometimes stings and burns, especially after facewash.

Now my acne hasn't particularly improved. Tell me what I should do, how long this will take to fix, and what I am doing wrong. Should I switch to acne-controlling products like facewashes with salicylic acid, over-the-counter ointments like AcneStar, etc.? Or should I keep it gentle and minimal, because I shouldn't damage my moisture barrier? Please, help me.

I have dry/sensitive skin, not acne prone. I attached some photos of my face both in natural and LED lighting. I think the redness is sun damage? I’ve had it forever and there’s no pain or itching involved. 

Main concerns are the redness on my chin and around my nose, and just overall wanting more of a dewy “clean girl” complexion. Also to prevent signs of aging as I’m 29 and (thanks beauty industry) am terrified of showing aging 😭 I know that’s an internal issue but I’d like to protect my skin nonetheless lol

1712250299.0,[Acne] Post-accutane skin/scalp itchiness and redness,"
Hello everyone, I was taking accutane for a year, but with very low doses. I started with 10 mg, then raised to 20 after 4 months and took 30 for like 2 months. My dermatologist made me stop because my cholesterol was getting higher. And I had high liver enzymes in the beginning, so she was going slow.

Anyways, it went okay, I just had some dryness on lips and eyes. But, ever since I stopped, the itchiness came back. I am super itchy on my scalp and on my chest too sometimes. My skin tends to get red, especially my nose and cheeks. I do get some pimples here and there and my bacne is not fully gone. I am thinking of doing another round… maybe higher doses? I also have sebborheic dermatitis, I used to get irritated around my nose. So I am not sure if the itchy scalp is connected to that. I am also very oily off accutane. I can feel my fave get oily during the day and jt can even be disturbing, I wanna wash my face, it feels clogged. I have a problem using SPF too.

Any recommendations would be appreciated. Should I go back on accutane? Maybe take low doses over long periods? I miss my skin without excess oiliness and it not being itchy. I use a special shampoo but it doesn’t help much.",SkincareAddiction

25f with combo skin who struggled with very persistent hormonal/cystic acne on my chin for years. I tried all the OTC products like BPO, AHA, BHA, adapalene, retinols but nothing helped. I had to reduce dairy and completely cut whey and animal based protein supplements because they turned my whole face into cysts. I turned to supplementing with vit D and spearmint tea a year ago which improved the acne a lot, but my skin destroyed itself all over again when I moved to a new city and these things no longer helped. 

But with being in a new (and bigger) I finally got to see a dermatologist and so happy I did, my skin hasn't felt this good in years. She prescribed me tretinoin and clindamycin and recommended I start using a benzoyl peroxide wash. 

I'm still at the point where my skin feels overall more textured and wrinkles/fine lines appear more visible than before I started, but that is slowly improving as well. I phased in the tretinoin to every day use over 6 weeks. I started the benzoyl peroxide cleanser at 10% and have since switched to 5%, as I found the higher concentration to be a little too drying/irritating and the 5% still does the job. 

The clindamycin helped a lot with the initial calming down until the tret could take effect. The BPO has kept my pores much cleaner than before.

Interestingly, I had tried BPO cleanser before, but it was the CeraVe brand which I didn't find did much for me at the time. The Differin brand cleanser, and perhaps it's in combination with the other products I'm using, works very nicely.",SkincareAddiction

1712244222.0,[Acne] Tazarotene has changed my life,"Figured it was worth coming on here and posting this little story in case it is useful to others. I have (had?) persistent hormonal acne on my chin for my entire 20s. For the last 5 years I've taken 100mg spironolactone daily, which truly has been a life saver for preventing big cysts and whiteheads that I used to get. But even on spiro, my chin and jaw area has just been so congested and full of flesh colored clogged pores which I ultimately pick at and destroy my skin. No BHAs, AHAs, etc would even make the slightest dent in these and tretinoin left me in a continuous purging state for like 6+ months where progress was being made but it was slow and painful (mentally).

After seeing someone on this sub post their results with tazarotene, I did a lot of research and ultimately asked my derm for an Rx. I had a 2-week long battle with my insurance about which formulation they would cover, I ended up with the generic gel formulation in .05% (insurance said no to name brand Tazorac and even no to generic cream).

I am still in the process of building my tolerance, but after a little over a month using it, I could literally cry with relief. ALL of my CCs are gone. I still get new ones (probably from my makeup) but tazarotene demolishes them pretty quickly. For the first time in maybe 10 years I wake up in the morning and am not immediately in a panic to see what my skin looks like that day. I can finally start to focus on other skin improvements (like lightening all of my hyperpigmentation from skin picking) instead of just targeting my acne.

Since I learned about it from this sub and did a lot of targeted searches within the sub to hear about people's experience with tazarotene I wanted to add in my experience in case it helps anyone!",SkincareAddiction

After accutane I was still getting breakouts about a week before my placebo pills. I talked to my gyno and we decided to switch me to Yaz. Pretty much immediately after starting Yaz I always have a least one cystic pimple on my face (anywhere from 2-3). I’m almost through my 2nd pack but I almost feel like my skin is getting worse. My dermatologist prescribed me Spiro 50mg then bumping up to 100mg after a week (I’ve been on this a little over a week now). I’d much rather deal with the pms breakouts rather than having 24/7 pimples. I’m soo discouraged and I don’t know if I should continue Yaz and see if pack 3 makes any difference but as the days go on and more pimples pop up I’m getting less hopeful. If I switch back to my old birth control after 2 months will my skin blow up even more? I’ve also been skipping my periods on Yaz (don’t know if that’s a good idea). ,SkincareAddiction
1712242002.0,"[Product Request] Moisturizer recs (adapalene, cystic acne)","Hi! I'd love to hear about your HG moisturizer, particularly if you have cystic (jawline) acne and/or are currently using adapalene (or any other retinoid).

Current routine:

AM- Splash with water, Paulas Choice 25% vitamin c*, Elta UV Clear SPF 46, makeup (Milk concealer)

PM- ELF holy hydration makeup melting cleanser, LRP toleriane cleanser, adapalene 0.1% gel*, Elta PM Therapy moisturizer

I alternate between using vit c in the morning and differin at night - I don't do them on the same day. Also, if my skin feels particularly dry, I use gold bond healing hydration instead of the Elta moisturizer (I know it isn't for faces, but it's really thick and feels good).

I have mild PCOS which is definitely a contributor to the cystic acne. Hormonal birth control isn't an option. Spiro has helped some in the past, but isn't currently an option because I'm breastfeeding and donating excess to the NICU (and Spiro isn't allowed for donation. Totally fine to be on it if you're just feeding your own kid though!)

Things I've tried and not really liked:

* Neutrogena water-gel and gel-cream; a derm recommended these and they felt *really* nice but I think the water-gel gave me CC and the gel-cream made the cystic acne worse
* LRP double repair moisturizer; used for a month, no change to cystic acne
* First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream; used for less than a month, almost immediately experienced an increase in cystic acne, didn't enjoy the feel
* Cetaphil, CeraVe- used these like a decade ago, but after they reformulated I started getting worse cystic acne. Haven't tried them in probably 7 or 8 years.
* Vanicream- used for a couple of months, no change really, didn't love the feel

Honestly, the Elta MD sunscreen has been one of my most consistently favorite products. I went through a phase where I used it as my moisturizer night and day and I do think there was a decrease in cystic acne but my skin was otherwise pretty dry after a while. I tried to introduce niacinamide on its own, thinking that had something to do with it, and it just made me super flushed and I don't think it didn't much.

I'd love something that feels light and absorbs like the Neutrogena water-gel, but at this point I'll take anything that doesn't exacerbate cystic acne. I do think one of the problems there is excess unexfoliated skin (and buried fine hairs) so if you have other Actives suggestions to help with that, I'm all ears.",SkincareAddiction

1712234119.0,[Acne] Differin longevity?,"

Hi, 20M, currently using Adap 0.1%/niacinimide 4%/ clindamycin 1% lotion and after steadily increasing the application to every night my acne that I’ve battled so hard for so long is finally clearing. 

I was really just wondering how long to use adapelene? (I’m aware clinda should stop being used after 3-6 months) 
People say forever and I don’t mind that but I’ve seen a lot of people also say that differin had stopped working for them.

Is it best to reduce the application of adapelene once it has cleared your skin? Maybe 2-3 times a week so you can ramp up the usage if your skin gets worse again. Not sure, ultimately just want to prevent this awesome stuff from a plateau! 

Any advice is appreciated ",SkincareAddiction

I have recently discovered this loose mattifying powder with sulfur and zinc PCA as active ingredients that's sold in German pharmacies and it really calms down my skin while also looking great cosmetically.

Tried Tretinoin in 2022 but only stuck with it for about 6 months & stopped…. I started using Tazarotene .1% on July 15, 2023. I stuck with it for a bit, but then started feeling like the cream version was still clogging my pores (just like the Tret cream was prior) & causing stubborn closed comedones. Soon after (I forget exact date), I switched to Tazarotene .05% gel. I started seeing much better results after switching to the gel version. I always monitored my progress by taking pictures when I had makeup on since that’s when my skin texture was MOST obvious to me. I hated wearing makeup for so long until now. I finally feel good when I get ready & can see the major improvement in texture under my makeup. I’m so happy & excited to see even more progress as more time passes!

As I'm become a bit older, I see more lines and wrinkles appearing, so I want to invest (both time and products) in my skin care. I've already read a lot of information on this site (so thanks!), I'm am hoping for some on advice on my current routine and possibly some products to add.   
Skin: rather dry + hyperpigmentation in the form of freckles (have had them my entire life and love them!). Not really prone to acne (I am very lucky that way :)), but a bit sensitive.  I also have dark circles under my eyes (since I was a kid). 

**Current Routine:** 

AM:   
Wash with water  
Eye cream: Clinique All about Eyes  
Day moisterizer: Eucerin Hyaluron-Filler +3x Effect + SPF 30  


PM:

Eye cream: Clinique All about Eyes  
Night Moisterizer: Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask

\- overall tips on my routine?   
\- Tips on cleansers that are very soft for the skin?   
\- Tips for the dark circles under my eyes: I have had them since I was a kid, so I don't think there is a magical solution here?   
\- Is there something I can add for prevention of more/thicker wrinkles? I was thinking of maybe adding a serum with Hyaluronic acid like La Roche-Posay Hyalu B5 Anti-Aging Serum?

she’s been asking me to create her a skincare routine for a while now, but i thought id just go ahead and buy her everything she needs as a gift. she’s 50 this year, and she has beautiful skin. she has hardly any wrinkles on her face, only has some crows feet near her eyes. she has pretty dry skin, and she gets especially dry/flaky on her nose area. she doesn’t have sensitive skin, and never breaks out or anything. 

her current routine is:
-st ives scrub as face wash (i’ve told her not to use this but she doesn’t listen lol)
-origins ginzing ultra hydrating cream (she only has this because i initially bought it & it was too intense for my skin. she loves it though)

i’m thinking of getting her a new cleanser, SPF, some serums/toners, and maybe a retinol? i am open to buying from anywhere, not just sephora. i also don’t really have a specific budget & id love to get her some nice skincare & maybe body care as well! body lotion, wash, etc.

1712207919.0,Pityrosporum folliculitis trigger? [acne],"Hello!

So, long story short, I woke up yesterday with my normal, clear skin. Took a shower and went about my day only to come home from errands and find a bumpy, textured forehead. 

I went to the derm today because it’s very odd for the skin on my forehead to get like that. It’s usually completely smooth. I thought maybe I had contact dermatitis or something because it’s also kind of textured along with the bumps(they’re only in the middle of my forehead and the right side and right temple, none of the left side). She diagnosed me with pityrosporum folliculitis pretty quickly, said it’s kind of stubborn to get rid of but since I caught it earlier on it should clear up faster than usual. Got prescribed all the usual stuff for it.

Anyways, I’m trying to figure out what the hell caused it. I haven’t chnaged my skincare at all. I do have bangs and blew dry my hair after I showered yesterday(round brushed my bangs) and specifically had to go over an unruly piece on the right side, so I’m wondering if an excess of hair product or maybe just a dirty brush are to blame for it(I’m not good at cleaning my hair brush, gross I know). But I just found it very odd for my skin to be acting up like this when it is normally clear albeit the random hormonal zit on my chin. 

*edit would also like to add that at the end of Feb, I had a miscarriage and a bad UTI that wouldn’t go away. Had to take a few rounds of antibiotics. So maybe either the hormones or the use of antibiotics caused the trigger of fungal acne on my forehead? I just got my period back a few days ago so maybe that? I would think because I stopped taking the antibiotics about a month ago that it would’ve triggered it then. I’m not sure lol. ",SkincareAddiction

I was looking into also purchasing the Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F and Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner. I’ve heard that the Glycolic Acid should only be used maybe once or twice a week but can I use all these products together and in what order?

We saw an opportunity to improve the mineral sunscreen experience and formulated a new sunscreen that would work well across all skin types, including sensitive skin. If you loved our previous sunscreen, you will love this one even more! If you had anything less than a favorable experience with our previous sunscreen, we want you to know that we have reformulated and retested to ensure maximum efficacy whilst being gentle on sensitive skin.

Unfortunately, I live in a really dry place and I can't seem to fight off redness / dryness for a long time. I have sensitive skin + mild rosacea + I get a bit of flare ups from rosacea when I have my period. Another problem I'm running into is that, if I moisturize in the morning, my face gets greasy (this includes using my current sunscreen which feels very heavy). 

So my current routine is:

AM: Bioderma Photoderm Aquafluide SPF 50+ (planning to switch from Aquafluide to Creme)

PM:   
1. Bioderma micellar cleanser foaming gel   
2. Metrocream on breakout spots (usually chin, sometimes cheeks)  
3. The Ordinary 0.3% Retinoid in Squalane  
4. Cetaphil hydrating cream for sensitive & dry to very dry skin   


So, my question is, what product would you recommend I incorporate here? I'm planning to substitute The ordinary Retinoid in Squalane with the Granactive Retinoid 2%. I'm looking for more hydrated skin without making it look oily - would you recommend an oil, a serum, a mask? All these products have agreed with me in general!

1712187943.0,Is it too late to start a proper skincare routine at 20? [Personal],"
Hello, first time poster here. 

I have acne-prone combination skin, oily on my front cheeks, chin and nose; and rest of my face is just dry- it feels as dry as a sandpaper really. I used too many commercial products (like nivea and neutrogena) for acne: cleansers and moisturizers- and actual ointments prescribed by dermatologists. Also some natural oils as well- only to have worse effects. I never had good results and stopped the treatment for acne due to terrible irritation and scars. I don't know much about skincare and that was the best I could do. 

I started using Yves Rocher products 3 weeks ago- only a cleanser with anti blemish feature and a moisturizer with sebum controller properties, and a regular sunscreen. Overnight I apply a thin layer of vaseline. The results are incomparable with all the products and medications I used. My acne visibly lessened, pores look cleaner even smaller, and my skin is glowing not because of excessive oil but in healthy way. 

I was wondering, am I too late? My friends have been Following routines for years and I just started having a proper one just now. I am actually worried about having wrinkles at early ages.

1712187858.0,Dapsone and spironolactone for mild acne? [acne],"So I’m 25f and I went to see a dermatologist yesterday about occasional hormonal acne and hair thinning/loss. Although my skin has never been fully clear, it’s mostly just flair ups and the hyperpigmentation (I have brown skin) left behind that bothers me. I don’t have severe acne at all, imo.  

That being said, the derm prescribed me dapsone and spironolactone, which I thought were used to treat more moderate/severe acne. I’ve never started medication before and am nervous, especially if I decide to get off of them. Does anyone have experience using these treatments for milder acne cases?

The Amazon one (left) has ridges along the top, the colour is a little different, and the text has scratched off really easily. The text on the one from their website will not come off.

1712178828.0,Tips and Advices for Helping Manage Seborrheic dermatitis [Product Question] [Routine Help] [Personal],"Hello everyone! I’m a new member in this community and I’ve always been just a silent reader here on Reddit so please bear with me. I’ve decided to post on here to ask for help as someone whose partner has just been newly diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis. 

Around June last year, my boyfriend went through a very stressful time with his studies. This is when his skin flare ups began, and he started noticing a certain type of inflammation all over his face. He described it to me as very itchy, warm, and very dry. Sometimes, it would go away for a few weeks but then it would also come back randomly. Basically, it is recurring and would often come during the most inconvenient times. We’ve also noticed a pattern wherein the flare ups would be worst when he is experiencing stress from exams, traveling, or sometimes, even the weather. Based on the information I’ve gathered from the articles I’ve read online and the community posts I’ve browsed on here, those are just some of the typical symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. 

I’ve been through a similar situation with my skin back in high school as I’ve struggled with fungal acne for over 4 years, which is why I know how difficult it must be for my boyfriend to be going through the same situation. As much as I want to help, there’s only so much I can do from reading and researching. I want to be able to actually become a good support system for him especially now that his skin condition has been taking a serious toll on his mental health. 

He’s gone to 3 different aesthetic/dermatologic clinics already, and unfortunately has had little to no luck in improving his skin condition. I could say that I’m a bit familiar with skincare and skin products thanks to the research I did back when I has acne, and personally, I don’t think the regimens prescribed to him before were helping him. One could even say that his skin got triggered even worse.

However, he visited a new clinic and a different dermatologist recently. I’ll update this post later on and list down the products prescribed to him and maybe you guys could give a heads up about the stuff to watch out from those products. It would be a huge help.

It would also be greatly appreciated if maybe you are experiencing or have experienced the same situation, could give tips, advice, reminders (what to watch out for)and even product/regimen recommendations for my boyfriend.

\-Acniben 1 facial cleaner, wash every night (I looked and this is for oily acne prone skin, mine is dry)  
\-Differin gel 0.1% all face at night every 48 hours

  
\-Benzac 2.5% spot treatment every night till it get better  
I do want the pimple to go away since its been 3 weeks, but the I am scared of Differin purging me as I've seen people talking about months of cystic acne purging. **Is it worth it if I don't deal with acne in the first place?**  
Derm said it would also help my skin look nice and help with some hyperpigmentation I have and I'm at risk of developing my freckles into melasma.

I routinely see people dropping their skincare routine here and there on many platforms and there's been no good way to have a universal ""profile"" live somewhere. Every time I go to Sephora (same store), different people will ask the same question ""what do you use, what have you tried, etc. etc."" and it seems like I'm repeating myself again and again (I have the Sephora app, not very helpful). Thinking about an app that generates a static webpage that shows what I use so my friends can know without having to download an app. This would be the sole purpose - to make it easier to share what i use and what i tried.

1712177307.0,[acne] tips for dealing with breakout from boyfriends beard?,"Hello everyone! I’ve been struggling with breakouts every time I’m with my boyfriend. It started as a small breakout but now it seems to keep spreading because a new breakout happens before the old one calms down. I’ve determined the breakout is likely caused by his facial hair rubbing against the side of my face when we kiss (especially when we are being intimate). The right side of my face is horrific while the left is completely clear. It’s very frustrating for me because I just finished a round of accutane in September. 

Everyone keeps telling me it’s not that bad, which frustrates me more because the majority of people haven’t dealt with acne to the same degree many of us have. It can be pretty scary to go on accutane and then start getting breakouts again (even if caused by your boyfriend’s beard LOL). 

Since Tuesday I’ve used Panoxyl in the morning and night (just on the affected area) AND I’ve also used a BP spot treatment. During the day (as post accutane treatment) my dermatologist has me using finacea :)

1712177197.0,Unusual TCA Peel Experience - Need Advice and Insight! [Personal],"Today I had a 20% TCA peel at a reputable clinic in my country, and something happened that I found quite alarming, prompting me to seek audience thoughts and advice.  
  
The procedure was performed by a practitioner who, I later discovered, is a general nurse practitioner. This was my first time getting a TCA peel, and based on what I’d read and heard, I was expecting a relatively quick application process. However, I was instructed to leave the peel on my face for 8 hours before washing it off with a gentle cleanser provided by the clinic. Additionally, I was given a cream to apply for the next two days post-procedure.  
  
From the research I've done, it seems that leaving a 20% TCA peel on for such an extended period is highly unusual and potentially risky, posing a significant risk of severe skin damage, such as chemical burns or scarring.  
  
I’m feeling a mix of emotions right now—confused, concerned, and frankly, a bit scared. I’m reaching out for a few reasons:  
  
Has anyone here experienced or heard of leaving a TCA peel on for 8 hours?  
  
What should I watch out for in terms of adverse reactions? If you have advice on signs of complications that require immediate medical attention, please share.  
  
Also, any advice on how to proceed with the clinic or practitioner? I’m contemplating the best course of action, including whether to address this directly with the clinic or seek external advice or reporting.  
  
Currently it's been 6 hours after my TCA procedure. There was initial moderate burning when it was applied but it subsided very quickly. After I left the clinic, there was no pain or discomfort. The skin looks like it had a moderate sunburn. It still is a little red. There are no alarming signs yet but I'm concerned that they might appear following the next days.  
  
So..should I be worried? What would be your recommendations?

As the title says, I (27f, UK) am new to proper skincare, that is, beyond moisturiser (usually with spf) and face masks. Part of the reasoning is that I have very sensitive skin, I very often have redness and spots from irritation for reasons that I'm sure change day to day.

I have combination skin I believe, but lately has been more on the dry side (with irritation, especially on cheeks/forehead, I've been trying new probiotics that made it worse but the 'extra' irritation has subsided a fair bit now). One of my main complaints is my skin looks dull, dark circles (always have been an issue) and while not 'saggy', could definitely have more of a clear/plump/glowy appearance. It's definitely a knock to my confidence and something I'm trying to sort.

I only really have a daytime routine with new products (marked *) started a few days ago but don't seem to be irritating my skin surprisingly.

• Face wash: Simple refreshing facewash or Simple exfoliating wash 

• Serum: Beauty of Joseon revive serum*

• Moisturiser: Simple (rotated through their brand, but it's one of the few that my skin can take)

• Sunscreen: BOJ relief sun*

Sometimes: Elf holy hydration sleeping mask, sheet masks (usually Garnier, with their moisture bomb on currently), Grüum retinol and vit c eye roller, Body Shop green tea mask, Witch Hazel 'calming' masks

Other than that I try and stay hydrated through water and copius amounts of green tea.

1712166469.0,[Sun Care] Mineral sunscreen with very inocous - with respect to smell - inactive ingredients?,"I go out for bicycle rides on the regular, typically 2-1/2 hours for a weekend ride. I'm not completely covered by clothing, so sunscreen comes into play.

My challenge is that I have loved ones who are very, very sensitive to smells. Even if I scrub pretty thoroughly with washcloth and soap in my post-ride shower, the sunscreens I have tried so far still leave enough residual smell to cause a problem (e.g., can't sit down with my family for a meal without ruining it for them).

Our working hypothesis at the moment is that it's something in the inactive ingredients that is the culprit, as it has happened even with a mineral-based sunscreen. So, I'm looking for something that has inactive ingredients that might be less olfactorily objectionable to said loved ones. I don't think that I could beat this problem by using a product that deliberately adds fragrance, so I'm looking for something that is fundamentally more inocuous than what seems to be commonly used for inactive ingredients.

One candidate might be Badger Adventure Mineral cream. That uses sunflower seed oil, beeswax, and tocopherol. The downside is the price: USD 15-17 for a 2.9 fl. ox. tube, depending on whether it's SPF 30 or SPF 50.

I did find a recommendation on Reddit for one sold by Whole Foods under their 365 brand. It's their [30 SPF ""Sport Lotion Mineral Sunscreen""](https://www.amazon.com/365-Everyday-Value-Mineral-Lotion/dp/B07DFNW4DC), and it shows the same inactive ingredients as Badger, plus a couple of other plant oils. The other difference is that, in contrast to Badger, they do not claim that the zinc oxide is ""nano"" in nature. USD 9.99 for 6 fl. oz. makes this about 1/3 the price of Badger.

The only thing that I find concerning about the Whole Foods 365 product is that there are a significant number of reviews claiming that it simply did not work as a sunscreen - as in, the reviews claim that people used it, and got sunburned. I can disregard a bad review from what appears to be the occasional crank, nitwit, or sincerely confused person, but there were enough of these that seemed genuine to give me pause.

So, OK, down to specific questions:

* **Does anyone have personal experience with the Whole Foods 365 product?**
* **Any personal recommendations (or non-recommendations) for other sunscreens that use plant oils and beeswax as the inactive ingredients? Other similarly inocuous inactive ingredients?**

1712162146.0,[Acne] Accutane Purging After 2 Years of Tretinoin?,"I have been on Tretinoin (.1%) for roughly 2 years now for my hormonal acne, for reference I am 18. I am heavily considering starting accutane, and have my initial appt. for my bloodwork set up, yet I am wondering one big thing: Having been on tretinoin for so long, will I purge from a low dosage of accutane? (Most likely will start on 10-30mg)I have seen a few mixed things regarding a question like this, so I decided to ask myself. Thank you in advance for any responses! I do plan on doing accutane regardless of the chances of my purging, but I would like to have a better idea of what could possibly happen in advance!",SkincareAddiction
1712161991.0,[Routine Help] How to tell if a product is proactively helpful vs useless?,"Hi! I've heard people say ""prevention is the best protection"" when talking about skincare. My question is: how do you know when a product you're using is actually proactive and helping protect your skin in the future vs something that's useless (whether that means the product is generally gimmicky, or just unnecessary for you and your particular skin's needs).  
I've been wondering if it's really necessary for me to be using all the products that I do, as I would like to use minimal products to not overdo it but am happy to continue using products that actually are worth it. I know you can't really know for sure, but wondering if anyone has any rules of thumb or tests etc. to help them decide whether or not a product is really worth continuing use?",SkincareAddiction
1712161384.0,[Product Question] this Niacinamide making my skin burn.,"I have been using Kleida’s niacinamide as recommended by my doctor. It was doing amazing until recently. I fell sick and couldn’t do my skincare that consistently so i stopped using that product for one week. Now I am using it again and it stinks/burns my skin. It used to happen before as well, sometimes but this time it is too much. I also noticed that when I didn’t do much skin care for that one week, my skin was doing amazingg and as soon as i started my skincare again, my skin is red and is breaking out. Should i stop using it?",SkincareAddiction

1712145266.0,[routine help] forehead irritation ,"

Hey! 
So my skin has always been weird in that whenever I do nothing to it it looks great (and I mean nothing)- no breakouts or spots, maybe some bumps under my eyes that I think are called millia? But the second I try a skincare routine, even if it’s nothing but wetting my face and then putting moisturiser on, it all goes to hell. When that happens I stop using anything until it goes back to normal…and then I tend to try again cause I don’t want the products to go to waste (dumb I know)

Sometime last year I tried again and used an expired (I didn’t notice at the time) vitamin C serum that I think caused this nasty reaction on my forehead. I got these little bumps/rash that itches like crazy and then got crusty/scabby and itched more. In the end I cut some bangs so I wouldn’t see it and stop picking at it. It cleared up to the point that it’s not itchy anymore, BUT it is VERY dry and flaky and will react negatively to anything other than Vaseline. I also have dry patches like that on an eye lid? 

Me being a dumbass, did a face mask (made of rice idk it was sticky) last night and now it’s back to being red. Not itching or dry and flaky, just red and irritated/raised, and I figured I could ask and see if anyone knows wtf it is or how to get rid of it. I do plan to see a dermatologist at some point but it just hasn’t been possible yet.

Hope this makes sense and would really appreciate any advice!! ",SkincareAddiction

1712158928.0,Salicylic acid newbie! [Product question],"Hi guys, I just got from amazon Paula's Choice Salicylic Acid 2%, which I've seen recommended around here.

My skin gets oily fast, like I could shower at morning and by noon I'd have oily skin.

I think that's what causes my pores to get clogged easily, my skin is uneven with this tiny darker spots around my cheeks, forehead and mostly nose. I'm aiming to have a more even skin. Will this salicylic acid thing help? Do you personally recommend the brand I just bought?

Also, I just applied it for the very first time, it feels like a kind of oil but when researching I can't find specific directions on usage. The bottle doesn't mention a timeframe, only to follow up with sunscreen. Do I have to rinse it off? ",SkincareAddiction

Any skincare outside of the normal basic AF moisturizer, cleanser, and Vaseline leaves my face stinging or at least super textured/irritated-looking.
